# Maintenance

## OCR Operations

<Callout type="info">
OCR (Optical Character Recognition) through Google Cloud Vision is launched on every new proof image automatically. However, you may need to run OCR on previously uploaded images for maintenance purposes.
</Callout>

<Steps>
<Step title="Run OCR on Previous Images">

To launch OCR on previously uploaded images, run the following command:

```bash title="Launch OCR on Previous Images"
make cli args='run_ocr'
```

</Step>
<Step title="Override Existing OCR Results">

To override existing OCR results, add the `--override` flag:

```bash title="Override Existing OCR Results"
make cli args='run_ocr --override'
```

<Callout type="warning">
**Use Override Carefully**

The `--override` flag will replace existing OCR results. Make sure you want to overwrite the current data before using this option.
</Callout>

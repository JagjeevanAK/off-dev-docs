You can translate Open Food Facts at https://translate.openfoodfacts.org thanks to the Crowdin platform. Please do not translate directly in the code, or your translations will be overwritten.

## Adding a translatable string in the code

<Steps>
<Step title="Modify the .pot file">
Modify the file with the `.pot` extension related to your context. Eg.

```pot title="Example .pot File"
msgctxt "name_of_your_string"
msgid "Hello world!"
msgstr ""
```
</Step>
<Step title="Modify the en.po file">
Modify the file `en.po` related to your context, to be sure at least an english string will be displayed before Crowdin send back all `.po` files (which can take several days). It should be the same code as the one from `.pot` + the english translation (see `msgstr` field). Eg.

```po title="Example en.po File"
msgctxt "name_of_your_string"
msgid "Hello world!"
msgstr "Hello world!"
```
</Step>
<Step title="Use the string in your code">
Use your new string with the `lang()` function. Eg. in a template file: `[% lang('name_of_your_string') %]`
</Step>
</Steps>

## Testing your modifications in dev environment

If you want to test your modifications in your dev environment:

<Steps>
<Step title="Modify test translation files">
Modify the `fr.po` files if you want to test in French; be aware it's just for test: these files will be overwritten by Crowdin. Eg. in French:

```po title="Example fr.po File"
msgctxt "name_of_your_string"
msgid "Hello world!"
msgstr "Salut le monde!"
```
</Step>
<Step title="Build language files">
Don't forget to `make build_lang` to let docker take your modifications into account
</Step>

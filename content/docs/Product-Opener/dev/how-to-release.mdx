import { Steps, Step } from 'fumadocs-ui/components/steps';

## Staging environment

This is automatically done by the CI of github, see `.github/workflows/container-build.yml`.

The deployment uses docker compose with specific environments variables and the `docker/prod.yml` overlay.

As soon as you merge a pull request in the `main` branch, the action is triggered. You can see it at https://github.com/openfoodfacts/openfoodfacts-server/actions/workflows/container-build.yml

## Production environment

Product Opener is deployed on a container in Proxmox. The container is a debian server, it must follow the `backend` container version.

In the command lines, I use $SERVICE and $VERSION variables, corresponding to the service short name (off, off-pro, obf, opf, opff) and the version tag (including the letter "v", e.g. "v2.55.0")

### Deployment steps

To deploy you need to execute the following steps:

<Steps>
<Step title="Create release">
**Create release**: merge the Release Please pull request. This will create a new release / version tag on github
</Step>
<Step title="Verify clean state">
**Verify clean state**: verify there is no unreleased code on the server:
```bash
sudo -u off bash
cd /srv/$SERVICE
git status
```
</Step>
<Step title="Update code">
**Update code**: update the code:
```bash
sudo -u off bash
cd /srv/$SERVICE
git fetch
git checkout $VERSION
```
</Step>
<Step title="Verify symlinks">
**Verify symlinks**: verify every needed symlink is in place
```bash
sudo /srv/$SERVICE/scripts/deploy/verify-deployment.sh $SERVICE
```
</Step>
<Step title="Rebuild taxonomies">
**Rebuild taxonomies**: rebuild taxonomies and lang
```bash
sudo -u off bash
cd /srv/$SERVICE
source env/setenv.sh $SERVICE
./scripts/taxonomies/build_tags_taxonomy.pl
./scripts/build_lang.pl
```
</Step>
<Step title="Update frontend assets">
**Update frontend assets**: update the frontend assets you just downloaded
```bash
sudo -u off /srv/$SERVICE/scripts/deploy/install-dist-files.sh $VERSION $SERVICE
```
</Step>
<Step title="Restart services">
**Restart services**: restart services
```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl restart nginx
sudo systemctl stop apache2 cloud_vision_ocr@$SERVICE.service minion@$SERVICE.service; \
sudo systemctl start apache2 cloud_vision_ocr@$SERVICE.service minion@$SERVICE.service
# On off
sudo systemctl stop apache2@priority; sudo systemctl start apache2@priority
```
</Step>
</Steps>

Here is how to develop for the producers platform using docker.

## Prerequisites

Docker should already be [set up for development](how-to-quick-start-guide.mdx).

## Shell Setup

You will need two types of shells:

<Tabs items={['Shell for OpenFoodFacts', 'Shell for OpenFoodFacts-Pro']}>
<Tab value="Shell for OpenFoodFacts">
Use this shell for general development on the OpenFoodFacts platform.
</Tab>
<Tab value="Shell for OpenFoodFacts-Pro">
Use this shell when working on the OpenFoodFacts-Pro platform.
To set up the shell, run the command: `. env/setenv.sh off-pro` (this simply sets some environment variables that will override the ones in `.env`).
Once the shell is set up, your prompt will show `(pro)` to indicate that you are in the producers environment.
</Tab>
</Tabs>

## Development Workflow

To develop on the producers platform, follow these steps:

<Steps>
<Step title="Open OpenFoodFacts-Pro Shell">
Open a shell for OpenFoodFacts-Pro.
</Step>
<Step title="Start Development Environment">
Run the command `make dev` to start the development environment. This command functions as usual.
</Step>
<Step title="Troubleshoot CSS (if needed)">
If you encounter any issues with CSS not showing up, you can run `make build_lang` in the *pro* shell.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Working with Product Import/Export and Interacting with the Public Platform

If you need to work on product import/export or interact with the public platform, you must start the following services: `PostgreSQL`, `MongoDB`, and the `Minion`. Here's how:

In a *non-pro* shell (OpenFoodFacts shell), run the command:
```bash title="Start Core Services"
docker compose up postgres minion mongodb
```

This command starts the necessary services in the background.

### Platform Switching

<Callout type="warning">
  The setup does not currently support running the http server for both public and pro platform at the same time.
</Callout>

To access the public platform, you need to follow these steps:

<Steps>
<Step title="Stop Frontend Service (Pro Shell)">
In your *pro shell*, run:
```bash title="Stop Frontend Service"
docker compose stop frontend
```
</Step>
<Step title="Start Frontend Service (Non-Pro Shell)">
In your *non pro shell*, run:
```bash title="Start Frontend Service"
docker compose up frontend
```
</Step>
</Steps>

Now, the public database can be accessed at `openfoodfacts.localhost`.

If you need to access the *pro* HTTP server, reverse these steps.

<Callout type="info">
  Note that if you use direnv, the setup should work seamlessly without redefining the variables set by setenv.sh.
</Callout>

An explanation of the setup can be found at [explain-pro-dev-setup.mdx](explain-pro-dev-setup.mdx)

## Task Management

If you want to see the state of tasks, you can run:

```bash title="Minion Task Status"
docker compose exec minion /opt/product-opener/scripts/minion_producers.pl minion job
```

(add --help to see all options), or refer to [Minion Job documentation](https://docs.mojolicious.org/Minion/Command/minion/job)

## Database Inspection

You may also inspect the database by running:

```bash title="Inspect PostgreSQL Database"
docker compose exec postgres psql -U productopener -W minion
```

The password is given by the `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` variable in the `.env` file and defaults to `productopener`. Inspecting the minion table can be helpful in understanding the database structure and contents.

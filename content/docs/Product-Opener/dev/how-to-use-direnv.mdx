As a developer, it can be better not to think too much about setting the right env variables as you enter a project. [`direnv`](https://direnv.net/) aims at providing a solution.

## Quick setup guide for Open Food Facts developers

<Steps>
<Step title="Install direnv">
Install direnv on your system using the usual package manager.
</Step>
<Step title="Configure your shell">
For Mac users you need to know if you are in zsh, bash, or something else; since 10.15 (Catalina) zsh is set by default, but to be sure type in terminal:

```bash
echo $SHELL
```

You have to adapt the direnv line according to what you use â†’ follow this official [direnv doc](https://direnv.net/docs/hook.html).
</Step>
<Step title="Create environment file">
In your project directory add a `.envrc` file, where you override variables from `.env` that you want to:

```bash
echo "setting up docker compose env"
export DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1
# The next two lines do the same thing in different ways; choose one.
export USER_UID=${UID}
export USER_UID=$(id -g)
```
</Step>
<Step title="Allow direnv">
In your project directory, run:

```bash
direnv allow .
```
</Step>
<Step title="Test the setup">
In a new shell:
- go to the project directory
- direnv should trigger and load your variables
</Step>
</Steps>

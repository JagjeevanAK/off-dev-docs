To avoid messing the product-opener repository with translations of web pages, we moved most pages in [openfoodfacts-web repository](https://github.com/openfoodfacts/openfoodfacts-web) specifically in the lang/ directory.

This repo only has a really minimal lang directory named lang-default.

## Setting up web content locally

If you want to have all contents locally, you should first clone openfoodfacts-web repo locally, and then:

<Steps>
<Step title="Using Docker">
If you are using docker, you can set the `WEB_RESOURCES_PATH` env variable to a relative or absolute path leading to openfoodfacts-web directory.
</Step>
<Step title="Using symlinks">
Else, make symlink `lang` point to openfoodfacts-web `lang` directory, and `html/off_web_html` point to openfoodfacts-web `html` directory.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Callout>
**Developer Success Story**

**Dave** regularly adds new products to the database and completes missing information via API calls. He has described the process below to show other developers how easy it is to contribute.
</Callout>

## Authentication and Header

<Callout type="info">
**Global Account Setup**

If you have an app that makes POST calls and you don't want your users to authenticate in Open Food Facts, you can create a global account.
</Callout>

Dave has created a global account for the app he is developing with the following credentials:

```json title="Global Account Credentials"
user_id: myappname
password: 123456
```

## Adding images to support your edit, and get machine learning predictions

<Callout type="info">
**Most Important User Action**

If you ask your users just one thing, it would be to send photos of the packaging (front, ingredients, nutrition, recycling, the more the better)
</Callout>

</Card>

## Sending the right country and language parameters

<Callout type="warn">
**Updated Recommendation**

We now advise to pass the `cc` and `lc` parameters within the query, and to limit assumptions as much as you can, especially in bilingual countries.
</Callout>

<Tabs items={['Traditional Approach', 'New Recommended Approach']}>
<Tab value="Traditional Approach">
Traditionally we advised to define the subdomain for the query as `us`. The subdomain automatically defines:
- Country code (`cc`) 
- Language of the interface (`lc`)

Example: `https://us.openfoodfacts.org/cgi/product_jqm2.pl?`
</Tab>
<Tab value="New Recommended Approach">
Pass the `cc` and `lc` parameters within the query to avoid assumptions, especially in:
- Bilingual countries (Belgium, US, etc.)
- Countries with imported products
- Multilingual product scenarios
</Tab>
</Tabs>

<Steps>
<Step>
**Determine Language**: Your UI or heuristic should determine which language(s) the data is in
</Step>
<Step>
**Upload Images**: We perform OCR on incoming images and make JSON available immediately
</Step>
<Step>
**Leverage OCR**: Use our OCR output or on-device ML to determine proper language
</Step>

## Product Barcode

After the version number, the word `code`, followed by its barcode must be added:

```bash title="Barcode URL Structure"
https://us.openfoodfacts.org/cgi/product_jqm2.pl?code=0074570036004
```

## Credentials

Dave adds his user credentials to the call as follows:

```bash title="URL with Credentials"
https://us.openfoodfacts.org/cgi/product_jqm2.pl?code=0074570036004&user_id=myappname&password=
```

## Parameters

You can define one or more parameters to add, for example, the brand and the Kosher label:

```text title="Parameter Examples"
brands: Häagen-Dazs
labels: kosher
```

The call looks like this:

```http title="Complete POST Request"
POST https://us.openfoodfacts.org/cgi/product_jqm2.pl?code=0074570036004&user_id=test&password=test&brands=Häagen-Dazs&labels=kosher
```

<Callout type="warn">
**Best Practice Recommendation**

We strongly advise to use `add_brands` and `add_labels` instead, even on new products, to reduce the potential of your users or your API destroying data by mistake. Use `brands` or `labels` only if you retrieve existing values, show them to your users, let them adjust them, and resend the whole dict with the proper format.
</Callout>

## Adding Additional Information to Existing Fields

To add additional information to existing parameters, add the prefix `add_` to the parameter name.

<Callout type="warn">
**Critical Warning**

If you don't use the `add_` prefix, the existing values will be deleted.
</Callout>

```http title="Adding Categories Example"
POST https://us.openfoodfacts.org/cgi/product_jqm2.pl?code=0074570036004&user_id=test&password=test&add_categories=Desserts
```

<Callout>
**Complete Parameters Reference**

To see the complete list of parameters, see the **Parameters** section.
</Callout>

## Adding a Comment to your WRITE request

Use the `comment` parameter to add the id of the user editing the product. The id should not contain any personal data.

<Callout type="warn">
**Important Distinction**

The user id is not the identifier of an Open Food Facts user, but the id generated by your system.
</Callout>

```bash title="Comment Structure"
Structure: user-agent + user-id
```

```bash title="Comment Example"
comment=Edit by a Healthy Choices 1.2 iOS user - SxGFRZkFwdytsK2NYaDg4MzRVenNvUEI4LzU2a2JWK05LZkFRSWc9PQ
```

**Automatic Data Extraction**

You can get automatic extraction of ingredients and nutrition facts from an image. Adding data like product name, ingredients and nutrition can help, but some predictions can be done with just images.

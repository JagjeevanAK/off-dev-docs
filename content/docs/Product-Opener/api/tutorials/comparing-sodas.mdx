<Callout>
**Use Case Scenario**

**Dave** wants his app to make an API call to provide Anna the information she needs to make a conscious choice when buying sodas.
</Callout>

## Authentication and Header

<Callout type="info">
**No Authentication Required**

To make the API query that returns the products that might be interesting for Anna, Dave doesn't need to authenticate (`READ` request).
</Callout>

<Callout type="warn">
**User-Agent Header Required**

He has to add a `User-Agent` HTTP Header with the name of his app, the version, system and a URL (if any), so that he doesn't get blocked by mistake.
</Callout>

```json title="User-Agent Example"
User-Agent: HealthyFoodChoices - Android - Version 1.0
```

## Subdomain

Since Anna lives in NY, Dave wants to define the subdomain for the query as `us`. The subdomain automatically defines:
- Country code (`cc`) 
- Language of the interface (`lc`)

```javascript title="Base URL"
https://us.openfoodfacts.org
```

<Callout>
**Region-Specific Results**

The country code determines that only the products sold in the US are displayed. The language of the interface for the country code `us` is English.
</Callout>

## API Version

The current version number of the Open Food Facts API is v0.

```javascript title="Versioned API Endpoint"
https://us.openfoodfacts.org/api/v0
```

## Product Barcode

After the version number, the word "product", followed by its barcode must be added:

```javascript title="Product Endpoint Structure"
https://us.openfoodfacts.org/api/v0/product/
```

## Product Comparison Example

The app will provide Anna with information about additives, sugars and nutriscore of different types of colas, to help her make her purchase decision.

<Steps>
<Step>
**Product Selection**: Anna selects the products she wants to compare in the application
</Step>
<Step>
**Barcode Retrieval**: The app retrieves the corresponding barcodes
</Step>
<Step>
**API Calls**: Make API calls for each product
</Step>
</Steps>

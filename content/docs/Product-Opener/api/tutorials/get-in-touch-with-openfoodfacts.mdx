## Tell us about your reuse

<Callout>
**We Want to Hear From You!**

We are very interested in learning what the Open Food Facts data is used for. It is not mandatory, but we would very much appreciate it if you [tell us about your re-uses](mailto:reuse@openfoodfacts.org?subject=Open%20Food%20Facts%20Data%20reuse) so that we can share them with the Open Food Facts community.

## Setting up a dedicated moderation channel for apps that contribute

<Callout type="info">
**Private Implementation Support**

We set up a moderation channel for apps that contribute, so that we can upstream any issues with your implementation (privately if you prefer). Ask early for your channel if you're willing to send data, we will help you with implementation and refinements.

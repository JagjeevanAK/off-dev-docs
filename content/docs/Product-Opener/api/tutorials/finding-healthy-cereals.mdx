<Callout>
**Use Case Scenario**

**Dave** wants his app to make an API call to provide Stefano healthy plant-based breakfast cereals.
</Callout>

<Callout type="warn">
**Search vs. Data Export**

This is a search use case. Please note that search is not a good way to extract info from the database, and anyone trying to do that will be rate-limited and banned. Please use the [data export](https://world.openfoodfacts.org/data) for convenient data extraction of the whole database and images.
</Callout>

<Callout type="info">
**Search-a-licious - New Search API**

We have an elastic-based revamp of the Search API upcoming, called search-a-licious. We need developer help to make it broadly available. Join the effort at [GitHub](https://github.com/openfoodfacts/search-a-licious) and on [Slack](https://slack.openfoodfacts.org) (#search channel).
</Callout>

## Authentication and Header

<Callout type="info">
**No Authentication Required**

To make the API query that returns products that might be interesting for Anna, Dave doesn't need to authenticate.
</Callout>

<Callout type="warn">
**User-Agent Header Required**

He has to add a User-Agent HTTP Header with the name of his app, the version, system and a URL (if any), not to be blocked by mistake.
</Callout>

```bash title="User-Agent Example"
User-Agent: HealthyFoodChoices - Android - Version 1.0
```

## Subdomain

Since Stefano lives in Italy, Dave wants to define the subdomain for the query as `it`. The subdomain automatically defines:
- Country code (`cc`)
- Language of the interface (`lc`)

```bash title="Italian Market URL"
https://it.openfoodfacts.org
```

<Callout>
**Region-Specific Results**

The country code determines that only products sold in Italy are displayed. The language of the interface for the country code `it` is Italian.
</Callout>

## Query Parameters

Dave wants to fine-tune the query to provide Anna with products that match her buying preferences. To do so, he wants to drill down the results to display only breakfast cereals.

<Steps>
<Step>
**Base Search Path**: First, add the search sequence after the https call: `/cgi/search.pl?`
</Step>
<Step>
**Define Tags**: Set tags and appropriate values
</Step>
<Step>
**Parameter Concatenation**: Parameters are concatenated with `&`
</Step>
</Steps>

### Basic Category Filter

```bash title="Category Filter Parameters"
action=process
tagtype_0=categories
tag_contains_0=contains
tag_0=breakfast_cereals
```

<Tabs items={['Parameter Explanation', 'Complete URL']}>
<Tab value="Parameter Explanation">
- `action`: introduces the action to be performed (process)

https://us.openfoodfacts.org/cgi/search.pl?action=process&tagtype_0=categories&tag_contains_0=contains&tag_0=breakfast_cereals
```
</Tab>
</Tabs>

<Callout>

With this query, the nutrition facts of more than 200 products are displayed.
</Callout>

### Adding Filters Progressively

<Steps>
<Step>
**Exclude Palm Oil**: Add parameter to exclude products containing palm oil ingredients

```bash title="Palm Oil Filter"
ingredients_from_palm_oil=without
```

<Card title="Updated URL" href="https://us.openfoodfacts.org/cgi/search.pl?action=process&tagtype_0=categories&tag_contains_0=contains&tag_0=breakfast_cereals&ingredients_from_palm_oil=without">

</Card>
</Step>

<Step>
**Exclude Additives**: Add parameter to exclude products containing additives

```bash title="Additives Filter"

</Card>
</Step>

<Step>
**Filter by Nutri-Score A**: Include only products with the highest nutrition grade

```bash title="Nutri-Score Filter Parameters"
tagtype_1=nutrition_grades
tag_contains_1=contains
tag_1=A
```

<Card title="Complete Filtered URL" href="https://us.openfoodfacts.org/cgi/search.pl?action=process&tagtype_0=categories&tag_contains_0=contains&tag_0=breakfast_cereals&tagtype_1=nutrition_grades&tag_contains_1=contains&tag_1=A&additives=without&ingredients_from_palm_oil=without">

</Card>
</Step>

<Step>
**Add JSON Output**: Add parameter to get JSON response instead of HTML

```bash title="JSON Parameter"
json=true
```

<Card title="Final API Endpoint" href="https://us.openfoodfacts.org/cgi/search.pl?action=process&tagtype_0=categories&tag_contains_0=contains&tag_0=breakfast_cereals&tagtype_1=nutrition_grades&tag_contains_1=contains&tag_1=A&additives=without&ingredients_from_palm_oil=without&json=true">

## How to leverage links to Wikidata (and Wikipedia)
<Steps>
<Step title="Understanding Wikidata Links">
You may have spotted things like https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q40050 in API outputs, especially those related to Taxonomies.
</Step>
<Step title="Accessing Encyclopedic Knowledge">
Whenever possible, Open Food Facts entities are linked to Wikidata, and in turn to Wikipedia. What this means is that you get access to a trove of additional encyclopedic knowledge about food. You can for instance get: Wikipedia articles about Camembert, the translation of salt in many languages, the molecular structure of a cosmetic ingredient...
</Step>
<Step title="Unambiguous Identifiers">
We provide the Wikidata QID, which is an unambiguous, stable and reliable identifier for a concept that will be useful to actually retrieve info from Wikipedia and Wikidata.
</Step>
</Steps>

### Example
[https://world.openfoodfacts.org/categories.json](https://world.openfoodfacts.org/categories.json)
```json title="Category Data Example"
{"linkeddata":{"wikidata:en":"Q40050"},"url":"https://world.openfoodfacts.net/category/beverages","name":"Beverages","id":"en:beverages","products":14196}
```
Beverages >> [https://world.openfoodfacts.org/category/beverages](https://world.openfoodfacts.org/category/beverages) >> Q40050 >> [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q40050](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q40050)

As you see, you'll get a beautiful image, information about the Quality label... As Wikidata is a Wiki, the knowledge you'll be able to retrieve will increase over time.

## Retrieving info from Wikipedia and Wikidata

You can use the Wikipedia and Wikidata APIs to get the information you want

* [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Data_access](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Data_access)
* [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php)

## Examples of things you can do

- Provide more context and more information about a specific Product, a Category of products, a Quality label, a Geography, a Brand, a Packaging material, an ingredient...
* Perform checks or computations by mixing Wikidata information and Open Food Facts information (and possibly other APIs)

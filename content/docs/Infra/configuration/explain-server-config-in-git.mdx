# Server Configuration with Git

<Callout title="Configuration Management">
For more and more services and servers, we use git to store the configuration files that are different from basic configuration.
</Callout>

The idea is to be able to follow server configuration evolution without (for now) using tools like ansible or similar tools (which may require more work and are not always as declarative as they pretend)[^pyinfra].

[^pyinfra]: By the way I would rather use [pyinfra](https://docs.pyinfra.com/en/2.x/) which is faster and far more flexible

## Implementation

### For Servers and Most Services

<Steps>
<Step>
### Repository Setup
On every server we have a `/opt/openfoodfacts-infrastructure` repository which is a clone of this project by `root`.
</Step>

<Step>
### Deploy Key Configuration
To be able to commit changes we add the root public key in deploy keys of the GitHub repository, with write access.
</Step>

<Step>
### Folder Structure
For each server, container, or VM, we have a folder in `/opt/openfoodfacts-infrastructure/confs`.
</Step>

<Step>
### Configuration Linking
As much as we can, we link the configuration files from the `/opt/openfoodfacts-infrastructure/confs` folder to the corresponding `/etc` folder of the server.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Callout type="info" title="Configuration Principles">
- We only commit files that differ from main distribution
- We try to commit minimal files, using includes and .d directories as much as possible
- Example: We use override definitions for existing systemd units ([use `systemctl edit`](https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/latest/systemctl.html#edit%20UNIT%E2%80%A6))
</Callout>

### For Services with Their Own Repository

<Callout title="Repository-Specific Configuration">
For services with their own repository we might prefer to store corresponding files in the repository itself.
</Callout>

**Example:**
This is the case for Product Opener (aka openfoodfacts-server), where we use the [conf directory](https://github.com/openfoodfacts/openfoodfacts-server/tree/main/conf)

### Committing Changes from a Server

<Callout title="Direct Commits">
While it's better to do a pull request for documentation and other things, it's perfectly ok to commit a configuration change or script change directly from the server on develop branch[^commit_develop].
</Callout>

<Steps>
<Step>
### Set Authorship
Ensure you put right authorship, setting GIT_AUTHOR_NAME and GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL[^git_author]
</Step>

<Step>
### Commit Changes
Commit your changes with a meaningful message (eventually more than one commit)
</Step>

<Step>
### Fetch and Rebase
Use `git pull --rebase --autostash` to fetch remote updates, while keeping your working changes (autostash)
</Step>

<Step>
### Push Changes
Use `git push` to push your changes to the remote
</Step>
</Steps>

[^commit_develop]: It's even the best choice on production servers to avoid having part of the configurations failing out of sync because you are on a specific branch, or taking the risk of messing things up, just for small changes.

[^git_author]: Don't hesitate to add a script in utils folder to do that.

## Limitations

<Callout type="warn" title="Known Limitations">
- There is no guarantee every needed configuration file is linked and monitored in git
- Some (rare) services do not accept symlinks
- Proxmox `/etc/pve` files are in fact a fuse mount of pve server configurations and not real files and can't be symlinked
- You must **take attention not to push files which contain secrets!**
</Callout>

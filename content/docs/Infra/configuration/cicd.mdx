# Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery

This document presents the Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) process at Open Food Facts.

<Callout type="info">
The information below is valid for most OFF repositories containing apps deployed on OFF servers. A summary table is given at the end to get the status of the deployment / test automation across different OFF repositories.
</Callout>

## Technology Stack

This section gives an overview on the technologies used to automate the CI and CD process at Open Food Facts.

### Makefile (*uniformity*)

<Callout type="tip">
The Makefile is the simplest entrypoint for collaborating to Open Food Facts repos, providing a uniform interface across different repositories.
</Callout>

A `Makefile` proves very useful for wrapping up and centralizing all the commands we run (locally or on remote environments) and have a lighter development and deployment process using simpler aliases.

Open Food Facts **contributors** should know that the Makefile is the simplest entrypoint for collaborating to Open Food Facts repos, although they are not mandatory if the user have a good knowledge of the application at hand.

`Makefile`s should stay away from complexities when possible and be streamlined enough that we can easily understand what the commands stand for.

<Steps>
<Step>
**Consistency Across Repositories**
It is important to be able to switch between the different Open Food Facts repositories but keep the same interface to set up our local developer workflow.
</Step>

<Step>
**Standard Commands**
Most of the existing OFF repos try to have the following commands in their `Makefile`:

- `make dev` - The only command needed to set up a complete developer environment after cloning the repo
- `make up`, `make down`, `make hdown`, `make restart`, `make status` - Map exactly to `docker-compose` commands
</Step>

<Step>
**Environment Support**
Using a different `.env` file (e.g: `.env.test`) is supported by setting the env variable `ENV_FILE=.env.test` so that the Make commands still work.
</Step>
</Steps>

### GitHub Actions

We use GitHub Actions to automatically run tests pull requests (unit / integration / lint / performance), but also to build and deploy Docker containers to pre-production and production environments.

<Callout type="info">
GitHub actions workflows are stored in `.github/workflows` in each repository.
</Callout>

In order to ease the deployments of new repositories and have uniform deployments across OFF apps, 2 GitHub Actions workflow templates were created, which can be setup by going to the `Actions` tab on the GitHub repo and selecting the "Docker image build" and "Docker Compose Deployment" actions:

![GitHub Action Workflows](../img/gh_workflows.png)

#### GitHub Bot

Some actions that needs their actions to trigger new actions, like [release-please](https://github.com/openfoodfacts/openfoodfacts-infrastructure/issues/84), needs a [PAT (Personal Access Token)](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token) for that.

<Callout type="info">
We created [a bot account](https://github.com/openfoodfacts-bot) for those cases. It's linked to `tech` mailing list.
Having a bot account is better than using personal account because it clearly identified that this is automatic generated stuff, but also because if you use your account to generate PRs, you won't be able to validate them!
</Callout>

## Continuous Integration

**Continuous integration** (CI) is the practice of automating the integration of code changes from multiple contributors into a single software project.

<Callout type="note">
It is essential in the DevOps space, as it allows developers to frequently merge code changes into a central repository where builds and tests are run.
</Callout>

A good CI process consists of the following:

<Cards>
<Card title="Pull Request Testing">
Run `style checks` as well as `unit`, `integration`, and `performance` tests on pull requests
</Card>
<Card title="Main Branch Deployment">
Deploy to a live environment and run integration tests on merge to `main` branch
</Card>
</Cards>

## Continuous Delivery

Continuous Delivery (CD) is the process of automatically deploying build artifacts (Docker containers, tars, static assets, data, etc…) to the target environment servers.

### Deployment Model

The diagram below represents a standard development git tree and how the deployment process wraps up around it. It shows the developers workflow to get a change into `net` and `org` environments, with the following principles in mind:

<Steps>
<Step>
**Pull Request Testing**
A pull request needs to be tested automatically before an administrator can merge it. Additionally, an administrator can deploy it to pre-production by pushing the PR branch to a new branch called `deploy-<something>`.
</Step>

<Step>
**Pre-production Validation**
Any change needs to be successfully deployed to pre-production before it is deployed to production.
</Step>

<Step>
**Automated Releases**
No humans should have to worry about making releases. The process should be fully automated.
</Step>
</Steps>

![GitOps deployment model](../img/cd_process.png)

The following diagram represents the same process, but seen from a persona perspective (Developer, Maintainer, Release Administrator):

### Deployment Workflow

<Tabs>
<Tab value="pull-requests" label="Pull Requests">
Run the `pull_request.yml` GitHub Action workflow that builds and runs unit / integration / load tests locally.
</Tab>

<Tab value="main-branch" label="Main Branch Commits">
On commit to `master` / `main`:
- Run the `release-please.yml` workflow that will **create a release branch** or **add the commit to an existing release branch**
- Run the `container-build.yml` workflow that will **build the container image** and **tag it with the merge commit SHA**
- Run the `container-deploy.yml` workflow that will **deploy the container image to the pre-production `.net` environment**
</Tab>

<Tab value="releases" label="Release Process">
- On **merge of branches matching `release-v*.*.*`**, run the `release-please.yml` workflow that will create the `v*.*.*` tag
- On **push to tags matching `v*.*.*`**, run the `container-deploy.yml` workflow that will reload the container image to the off-org environment
</Tab>

<Tab value="deploy-branches" label="Deploy Branches">
On **push to branches matching `deploy-*`**, run the `container-deploy.yml` workflow that will push the image to the pre-production (`.net`) environment. This is useful to quickly test a pull request in the pre-prod environment.
</Tab>
</Tabs>

<Callout type="warning">
**Important Notes:**
- Deployment process to pre-prod `.net` and production `.org` environments is identical (`container-deploy.yml`)
- The special branches (`deploy-*` and `release-v*.*.*`) MUST be **[protected branches](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/defining-the-mergeability-of-pull-requests/about-protected-branches)**
- Use GitHub SECRETS only for real secrets! For environment variables that depend on the deploy target, use [environment modification](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/workflow-commands-for-github-actions#setting-an-environment-variable) with an `if` directive
</Callout>

### Rollbacks

In the advent where pre-production or production environments are broken by a 'bad' change, it is important to be able to rollback to the previous version.

<Callout type="info">
Automated rollbacks are tricky with `docker-compose` (a discussion to migrate to `docker swarm` should be envisioned), but manual rollbacks are easily done.
</Callout>

<Tabs>
<Tab value="manual" label="Manual Rollback">
<Steps>
<Step>
SSH to the QEMU VM (either pre-production or production) and go to the deployment folder (usually named after the GitHub environment we are deploying to)
</Step>

<Step>
Replace the `TAG` variable by `sha-<COMMIT_SHA>` (where `COMMIT_SHA` is the last 'good' commit) in the `.env` file and restore it in the checked out repository
</Step>

<Step>
Copy the `.env` file outside of the checked out repository so that it can be restored later
</Step>

<Step>
Run `git checkout -qf <COMMIT_SHA>` of the last 'good' commit
</Step>

<Step>
Move the `.env` file from previous step into the directory
</Step>
</Steps>
</Tab>

<Tab value="automated" label="Automated Rollback">
<Callout type="tip">
This alternative is safer, although it can be a bit longer considering the git process.
</Callout>

<Steps>
<Step>
Revert the 'bad' commit (`git revert <COMMIT_SHA>`) and make a pull request
</Step>

<Step>
Push to a branch called `deploy-<something>` to deploy to pre-prod
</Step>

<Step>
**Merge the pull request**: the release workflow runs and creates a new release branch
</Step>

<Step>
**Merge the release branch**: the revert will be deployed in production
</Step>
</Steps>
</Tab>
</Tabs>

## Q&A

<Cards>
<Card title="Container deployment is failing">
Have a look at the `Actions` tab in the GitHub repository and finds out why it is failing. If the process has trouble checking out the appropriate commit sha, you might have to ssh to the machine, bring down the deployment (`make down`) and delete the repository folder. It will be automatically re-created for the next deployment.
</Card>

<Card title="Forgot to set an env variable">
Yes, simply make an empty commit to your deployment branch: `git commit --allow-empty -m "trigger" && git push`. You can also re-trigger a deployment in the repo's `Actions` tab, assuming you are a repo maintainer.
</Card>

<Card title="Set up deployment on new repository">
Go to the `Actions` tab and click on `New workflow`: scroll down to `Workflows created by Open Food Facts` and click on `Set up this workflow` for both `Docker image build` and `Docker Compose Deployment` workflows. You will also need to create two GitHub environments and set up required secrets.
</Card>

<Card title="Deployment fails after merging PR">
Contact an OFF administrator to analyze why it is failing. The admin might have to revert your PR to restore the previous working version in pre-production. Ask the OFF administrator to deploy your PR before merging it.
</Card>

<Card title="Release candidate before official release">
Yes, assuming your next version is `v1.1.0`, just create a git tag following semantic versioning using `git tag v1.1.0rc1 && git push --tags` and the automated process will deploy this release candidate to production.
</Card>

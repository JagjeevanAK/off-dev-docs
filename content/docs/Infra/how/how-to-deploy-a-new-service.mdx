# How to Deploy a New Service

Open Food Facts is made of several components and tools for the community and infrastructure management.

<Callout type="info">
Each service will cost resources and have certain requirements to run. It's important to keep those things in mind when deploying a new service.
</Callout>

## Deployment Process Overview

<Steps>
  <Step>
    **Decide Deployment Method**
    
    Choose between Docker Compose or Proxmox containers based on service requirements.
  </Step>
  
  <Step>
    **Select Target Server**
    
    Choose the best server considering resources, latency, and criticality.
  </Step>
  
  <Step>
    **Separate Data from System**
    
    Implement proper data separation for reliability and maintenance.
  </Step>
  
  <Step>
    **Monitor Performance**
    
    Track system performance before and after deployment.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Deployment Methods

<Tabs>
  <Tab value="docker" label="Docker Compose">
    ### Docker Compose Deployment
    
    <Callout type="tip">
    Using [Docker Compose](./docker_architecture.md) is the **preferred way** to deploy services that have active development.
    </Callout>
    
    **Benefits:**
    - Easy upgrade of main components
    - Good reproducibility of the environment
    - Excellent integration with [CI/CD tools](./cicd.md)
    
    **Deployment target:**
    - Deploy in a VM (recommended)
    - Container deployment is experimental (no official support yet)
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab value="proxmox" label="Proxmox Container">
    ### Proxmox Container Deployment
    
    <Callout type="note">
    Using a [Proxmox container](./proxmox.md#how-to-create-a-new-container) is the second-best option.
    </Callout>
    
    **Best for:**
    - Services packaged in Debian
    - Software that updates easily in container environments (e.g., PHP applications)
    
    **Use cases:**
    - Static services with minimal development
    - Well-established applications with stable requirements
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Server Selection

<Callout type="warning">
Server selection should be done in coordination with the infrastructure team.
</Callout>

    CPU, RAM, and storage needs analysis
  </Card>
  <Card title="Network Latency" href="#factors-to-consider">
    Access to other services and external systems
  </Card>
  <Card title="Service Criticality" href="#factors-to-consider">
    Uptime requirements and failure impact
  </Card>
</Cards>

### Factors to Consider

- **Resources needed by the service**: CPU, RAM, storage requirements
- **Latency needed to access other services**: Network topology considerations
- **How critical the service is**: Uptime requirements and redundancy needs

## Separating Data from System

<Callout type="info">
It's important to try to separate data from the system for reliability and maintainability.
</Callout>

### Data Types

<Cards>
  <Card title="Primary Source Data" href="#data-types">
    Critical data that cannot be regenerated
  </Card>
  <Card title="Indexes" href="#data-types">
    Data that can be rebuilt from primary sources
  </Card>
  <Card title="Caches & Temp Data" href="#data-types">
    Temporary data that can be safely lost
  </Card>
  <Card title="Logs & Configs" href="#data-types">
    System logs and configuration files
  </Card>
</Cards>

### Benefits of Data Separation

<Steps>
  <Step>
    **Safe System Updates**
    
    Update the system without putting data at risk and enable rollback without losing data.
  </Step>
  
  <Step>
    **Performance Optimization**
    
    Put data on faster disks if needed for better performance.
  </Step>
  
  <Step>
    **Backup Strategy**
    
    Implement targeted backup strategies for different data types.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Callout type="note">
If your service is not very important, doesn't have much data, and you can afford losing some data, separation might not be worth the effort.
</Callout>

## Performance Monitoring

<Callout type="warning">
If your service is heavy duty, try to do some performance checks in staging before production deployment.
</Callout>

### Post-Deployment Monitoring

After deployment, check how the new service impacts overall system performance.

<Callout type="tip">
[Munin](./munin.md) offers a good way to check system performance, as you can compare before and after deployment metrics.
</Callout>

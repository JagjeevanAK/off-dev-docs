# How to Resync ZFS Replication

<Callout type="info">
It happens that some time, syncoid fails for too long to replicate a dataset, and it become out of sync.

In this case, we normally get an error email thanks to `sanoid_check` script.
</Callout>

## Checking State

<Steps>
<Step>
**Check Snapshot Status**
On the backup host and on the source host, use `zfs list -t snap /path/to/dataset|tail` to check the status.
</Step>

<Step>
**Search for Common Snapshots**
Search if the oldest snapshot on backup side is still available on the source host:

```bash title="Check Snapshot Availability"
zfs list <dataset-name-on-backup>@<snapshot-name-on-backup-side>
```
</Step>

<Step>
**Find Nearest Common Snapshot**
If it's not the case, you have to search for the nearest common snapshot. It would probably be a "_daily" one or a "_monthly" one.

<Tabs>
<Tab value="daily" label="Daily Snapshots">
```bash title="Check Daily Snapshots"
zfs list -t snap /path/to/dataset|grep "_daily"|tail
```
</Tab>

<Tab value="monthly" label="Monthly Snapshots">
```bash title="Check Monthly Snapshots"
zfs list -t snap /path/to/dataset|grep "_monthly"|tail
```
</Tab>
</Tabs>

Check then availability on source side (same for `_monthly`).
</Step>
</Steps>

<Callout type="note">
When you have found the nearest common snapshot, you can resync.
</Callout>

## Resyncing Process

<Steps>
<Step>
**Rollback to Common Snapshot**
On the backup host, rewind to the common snapshot:

```bash title="Rollback to Common Snapshot"
zfs rollback <dataset-name-on-backup>@<common-snapshot-name>
```
</Step>

<Step>
**Handle vzdump Snapshots**
<Callout type="warning">
If you have an existing vzdump snapshot `zfs list -t snap <dataset-name-on-backup>|grep @vzdump`, this is some snapshot used by Proxmox during a backup, but it might not be the same as the one on source side (it's constantly recreated), and will get in your way.

So you have to remove it on backup side:
</Callout>

```bash title="Remove vzdump Snapshot"
zfs destroy <dataset-name-on-backup>@vzdump
```

<Callout type="info">
See also [Dealing with vzdump snapshots](./sanoid.md#dealing-with-vzdump-snapshots)
</Callout>
</Step>

<Step>
**Resume Synchronization**
You can then, either wait for next sync to catch up, or launch the sync manually using syncoid.

<Callout type="tip">
If launching manually, you have to craft the command by looking at syncoid-args.conf, but beware of not using --recursive option, and using the dataset name on source side and target side.
</Callout>
</Step>
</Steps>

## Alternative Resolutions

<Card title="Removed Source Dataset">
The source dataset might have been removed (because a container / VM was removed).
</Card>

<Callout type="info">
In this case decide if you want to keep the data:
- **If not:** You can destroy it
- **If yes:** You have to consider moving the dataset to another location, to avoid messing with current / future datasets on the host
</Callout>

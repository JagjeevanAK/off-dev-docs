# How to Ban Bots with Fail2ban

Learn how to configure and use Fail2ban to protect your servers from malicious bots and automated attacks.

<Callout type="info">
Fail2ban monitors log files and automatically bans IP addresses that show malicious behavior, such as too many authentication failures or bot-like activity.
</Callout>

## Installation and Setup

<Steps>
  <Step>
    **Install Fail2ban**
    
    ```bash title="Install Fail2ban"
    sudo apt install fail2ban
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step>
    **Debian 11+ Configuration**
    
    <Callout type="note">
    On Debian 11, additional configuration is required. Follow [How to install fail2ban on debian 11+](./how-to-fail2ban-debian-11+.md)
    </Callout>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Standard Filter Configuration

<Callout type="info">
We install these filters with standard configurations across our infrastructure.
</Callout>

<Cards>
  <Card title="nginx-botsearch" href="#standard-filters">
    Bans bots that blindly search for old software installations
  </Card>
  <Card title="nginx-http-auth" href="#standard-filters">
    Bans bots making too many failed authentication attempts
  </Card>
  <Card title="sshd" href="#standard-filters">
    Protects SSH connections from brute force attacks
  </Card>

  </Card>
</Cards>

## Manual Ban Jail Configuration

Create a jail for manually banning problematic IP addresses that automated filters might miss.

<Steps>
  <Step>
    **Enable Manual Ban Jail**
    
    ```bash title="Enable nginx-manual-ban Jail"
    ln -s /opt/openfoodfacts-infrastructure/confs/common/fail2ban-nftables/jail.d/nginx-manual-ban.local /etc/fail2ban/jail.d/
    systemctl restart fail2ban
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step>
    **How It Works**
    
    - Uses `nginx-botsearch` filter on a fake log file
    - Allows manual IP addition to the jail
    - Permanent ban time for manually added IPs
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Callout type="note">
**Persistence**: Fail2ban (recent versions) is naturally persistent across reboots using a SQLite database in `/var/lib/fail2ban/`.
</Callout>

## Managing Fail2ban

    ### Status and Logs
    
    ```bash title="Check Overall Status"
    fail2ban-client status  # See all running jails
    ```
    
    ```bash title="Check Specific Jail"
    fail2ban-client status sshd  # Status for specific jail: banned addresses, etc.
    ```
    
    ```bash title="Monitor Logs"
    tail -f /var/log/fail2ban.log  # Watch fail2ban activity in real-time
    ```
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab value="management" label="IP Management">
    ### View Banned IPs
    
    ```bash title="List Banned IPs"
    sudo fail2ban-client status nginx-manual-ban
    ```
    
    ### Ban an IP Address
    
    ```bash title="Manual IP Ban"
    sudo fail2ban-client set nginx-manual-ban banip <IP>
    ```
    
    <Callout type="tip">
    Supports IP ranges: `123.456.789.1/24`
    </Callout>
    
    ### Unban an IP Address
    
    ```bash title="Unban IP"
    sudo fail2ban-client set nginx-manual-ban unbanip <IP>
    ```
  </Tab>

### Best Practices

<Steps>
  <Step>
    **Regular Monitoring**
    
    Check fail2ban status regularly to ensure it's working correctly.
  </Step>
  
  <Step>
    **Log Review**
    
    Monitor `/var/log/fail2ban.log` for patterns and false positives.
  </Step>
  
  <Step>
    **Whitelist Management**
    
    Ensure legitimate IP ranges are whitelisted to prevent accidental bans.
  </Step>
  
  <Step>
    **Filter Tuning**
    
    Adjust filter sensitivity based on actual attack patterns observed.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Callout type="warning">
Be careful when manually banning IP ranges. Always verify you're not blocking legitimate traffic or your own access paths.

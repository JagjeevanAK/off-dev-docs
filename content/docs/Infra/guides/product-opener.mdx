# Product Opener Overview

Product Opener is the backend that powers the Open Food Facts website and mobile apps, and all the other siblings projects (Open Beauty Facts, Open Pet Food Facts, Open Products Facts...).

## Deployment Overview

<Tabs>
<Tab value="staging" label="Staging Environment">
<Card title="Staging Deployment">
In staging, Open Food Facts is deployed on the ovh1 server (ovh1.openfoodfacts.org), in a proxmox VM (201) specific to all staging services.
</Card>

<Callout type="note">
Other sibling projects are not deployed in staging.
</Callout>
</Tab>

<Tab value="production" label="Production Environment">
<Card title="Production Deployment">
In production, it's deployed on the off2 server (off2.openfoodfacts.org).
</Card>

Each flavor of Open Food Facts is deployed in its own proxmox VM:

| Flavor | VM |
| ---- | --- |
| OPFF | 110 |
| OBF  | 111 |
| OPF  | 112 |
| OFF  | 113 |
| OFF-PRO | 114 |

<Callout type="info">
The internal IP of the VMs is `10.1.0.{VMID}`.
Once connected on the off2 server, OFF can therefore be accessed on `10.1.0.113`.
</Callout>
</Tab>
</Tabs>

## How to Connect to the Server (Production)

<Steps>
<Step>
**Get Server Access**
First, you need to have access to the off2 server with root access.
</Step>

<Step>
**Create User Account**
Once you have access, you need to create a user within the VM. This user will be used to connect to the VM.

<Callout type="info">
A clone of the [openfoodfacts-infrastructure](https://github.com/openfoodfacts/openfoodfacts-infrastructure) repository is already present in `/opt/openfoodfacts-infrastructure/`. This is where all scripts and configuration files are stored.
</Callout>
</Step>

<Step>
**Run User Creation Script**
Go to the `/opt/openfoodfacts-infrastructure/scripts/proxmox-management` directory and run with root privileges:

```bash title="Create User"
./mkuseralias
```

This script will ask you the name of the user you want to create and your Github ID (to add your public key registered on Github to the user's authorized keys).
</Step>

<Step>
**Connect to VM**
Once the user is created, you can connect to the VM from off2 (proxy jump) with:

```bash title="Connect to VM"
ssh {user}@{VM_IP}
```
</Step>

<Step>
**Configure SSH (Optional)**
You can add the following configuration to your `~/.ssh/config` file to make it easier to connect to the VM (don't forget to replace `{user}` with the name of the user you created):

```sh title="SSH Configuration"
Host off2
    HostName off2.openfoodfacts.org
    User {user}

Host off
    HostName 10.1.0.113
    User {user}
    ProxyJump off2
```

You can now connect to the VM with `ssh off`.
</Step>
</Steps>

## File Locations

<Callout type="info">
Everything is stored in the `/srv/{flavor}` directory.
For example, for OFF, the directory is `/srv/off`.
</Callout>

<Cards>
<Card title="Log Files">
- All logs are stored in `./logs`
- NGINX logs: `./logs/access.log` and `./logs/error.log`
- Application logs: `./logs/log4perl.log`
</Card>
<Card title="Image Files">
Images are stored in `./images/products`
</Card>
</Cards>

## Service Management

<Tabs>
<Tab value="apache" label="Apache Server">
<Callout type="info">
The apache server is managed by systemd.
</Callout>

```bash title="Restart Apache"
sudo systemctl restart apache2
```
</Tab>

<Tab value="cron" label="Scheduled Tasks">
<Callout type="note">
We don't use cron anymore to manage scheduled tasks, we use systemd timers instead.
</Callout>

You can find all the timers in `/etc/systemd/system/`.

# Discourse

[Discourse](https://www.discourse.org/) is a forum application.

<Callout type="info">
It is installed on our Proxmox infrastructure in a QEMU virtual machine (202).
</Callout>

## Software Installation

<Card title="Installation Location">
Software is installed in `/var/discourse`.

We use the https://github.com/discourse/discourse_docker.git.
</Card>

The docker configuration is contained in `config/app.yml`

<Callout type="note">
It creates a unique docker container containing whole application, postgresql and redis database, and so on!

It defines volumes where all the data is found. It's in `/var/discourse/shared/standalone` and mounted in container as `/shared`
</Callout>

<Callout type="tip">
You might get a shell into the docker container using `./launcher enter app bash`.
</Callout>

## Mail Configuration

<Callout type="warning">
Mail is very important as a lot of notifications are sent by the forum. 

The sender email [have to be on main domain](./mail.md#only-domain), NOT forum.openfoodfacts.org.
</Callout>

<Cards>
<Card title="Test Mail" href="https://forum.openfoodfacts.org/admin/email">
Mail can be tested at the admin email interface
</Card>
<Card title="Mail Gateway" href="./mail.md">
We use Proxmox mail gateway for email delivery
</Card>
</Cards>

## Software Update

<Callout type="warning">
Please respect the following procedure to avoid issues during upgrades.
</Callout>

<Steps>
<Step>
**Make a Snapshot**
Make a snapshot before upgrade to ensure rollback capability.
</Step>

<Step>
**Try Web Interface Upgrade**
Try to upgrade through the web interface: https://forum.openfoodfacts.org/admin/upgrade (you need to be an admin)
</Step>

<Step>
**Test the Update**
Test the update during several days to ensure stability.
</Step>

<Step>
**Clean Up**
After several days, if everything is fine, you can delete the snapshot.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Callout type="info">
While upgrading via the web interface, you could possibly get this error message:

```
You are running an old version of the Discourse image.

Upgrades via the web UI are disabled until you run the latest image.

To do so log in to your server using SSH and run:
		cd /var/discourse
		git pull
		./launcher rebuild app
```
</Callout>

### Manual Upgrade Process

In case the web interface upgrade fails, you have to upgrade in a Linux shell directly on the VM:

<Steps>
<Step>
**Access the Server**
1. Get root access on ovh1: `sudo su root`
2. Connect yourself to the VM: `ssh 10.1.0.202`
</Step>

<Step>
**System Updates**
```bash title="Update System"
apt update && apt dist-upgrade # updates the whole system
```
</Step>

<Step>
**Cleanup**
```bash title="Clean Up"
cd /var/discourse
./launcher cleanup # cleans old docker images
apt-get autoclean
apt-get autoremove
```
</Step>

<Step>
**Create Snapshot**
Create a snapshot if haven't done it yet!
</Step>

<Step>
**Rebuild Application**
```bash title="Rebuild Discourse"
git pull
./launcher rebuild app
```
</Step>
</Steps>

## Analytics with Matomo

We setup analytics with Matomo on the forum.

<Callout type="info">
There is a theme: https://meta.discourse.org/t/matomo-analytics/33090
</Callout>

### Setup Process

<Steps>
<Step>
**Create Website in Matomo**
I created the website in Matomo. Site id is 8.
</Step>

<Step>
**Install Theme in Discourse**
- Go to administration / Customize / theme
- Install / from a git repository: https://github.com/paviliondev/discourse-matomo-analytics.git
</Step>

**Configure Settings**
Settings:
- Include component on these themes: **Default** (using button *add to all them*)
- host url: `analytics.openfoodfacts.org`

- do not track: **yes**
- disable cookies: **yes** (keep GDPR compatibility)
</Step>

<Step>
**Update Content Security Policy**
Discourse is very specific in it's Content Security Policy headers, so we have to add an entry for Matomo.
- Go to administration / settings / security
- In content security policy script src, add entry: `https://analytics.openfoodfacts.org/piwik.js`
</Step>
</Steps>

```
</Step>
</Steps>

<Callout type="warning">
Found this warning, and solved by implementing its advice:

`WARNING Memory overcommit must be enabled! Without it, a background save or replication may fail under low memory condition. Being disabled, it can can also cause failures without low memory condition, see https://github.com/jemalloc/jemalloc/issues/1328. To fix this issue add 'vm.overcommit_memory = 1' to /etc/sysctl.conf and then reboot or run the command 'sysctl vm.overcommit_memory=1' for this to take effect.`

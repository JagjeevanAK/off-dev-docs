<Steps>
  <Step title="Remove Monitoring Containers">
    Removed the `monitoring/` docker containers and volumes using `docker-compose down -v` and deleted the folder
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Clean Docker Volumes">
    Executed `docker volume prune` to reclaim additional space
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Space Reclaimed">

  </Step>
</Steps>

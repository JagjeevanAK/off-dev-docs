</Callout>

## 2023-01-19

<Card

## 2023-01-02

<Callout type="warn" title="Gateway Error">
openpetfoodfacts.org answers with a 502 bad gateway.
</Callout>

**Troubleshooting:**
- `curl --header "Host: world.openpetfoodfacts.org" http://10.1.0.110:80/` does not work from proxy
- Same command works from off2
- **Solution**: The problem solved when launching `ping 10.1.0.101` from opff (110)
- **Root cause**: ARP problem

## 2023-10-23 (VM 101) openpetfoodfacts SSL certificate expired

<Callout type="warn" title="SSL Certificate Issue">
The website https://fr.openpetfoodfacts.org uses a certificate expired on 2023-10-20 and issued on July 22nd.
</Callout>

**Investigation:**
- `certbot renew` says nothing is to be renewed
- Checked `/etc/letsencrypt/live/openpetfoodfacts.org/` and `/etc/letsencrypt/archive/openpetfoodfacts.org/` and configuration - all seems ok

**Resolution:**
```bash title="SSL Certificate Fix"
systemctl reload nginx
```

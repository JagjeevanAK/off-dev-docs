# 2023-06-07 OFF and OFF-pro reinstall on off2

We will follow closely what we did for [OPFF reinstall on off2](./2023-03-14-off2-opff-reinstall.md).
Refer to it if you need more explanation on a step.
Also following [OPF and OBF reinstall on off2](./2023-06-07-off2-opf-obf-reinstall.md).


## switching to right branch of off2 and ovh3

On ovh3 and off2 we will set the branch to `off2-off-reinstall` to have modifications synced.
```bash
cd /opt/openfoodfacts-infrastructure
git fetch
git checkout off2-off-reinstall
```

We will continuously push and pull on this branch.

## removing zfs-old and adding as cache to zfs-hdd

`nvme3n1p2` is in zfs-old and has no utility right  now.

```bash
zpool destroy zfs-old
```

But as `zfs-nvme` is in mirror it's no use adding it as a new  device there.

Instead we can add it as a cache to `zfs-hdd` to improve performance.

```bash
zpool add zfs-hdd cache nvme3n1p2
```

## installing a postgresql container

### Created CT

I created a CT for OFF followings [How to create a new Container](../proxmox.md#how-to-create-a-new-container) it went all smooth.

It's 120 (off-postgres)

I choosed a 20Gb disk on zfs-hdd, 0B swap, 2 Cores and 2 Gb memory.
I added a disk on zfs-nvme mounted on /var/lib/postgresql/ with 5Gb size and noatime option.

I did not create a user.

I also [configure postfix](../mail.md#postfix-configuration) and tested it.

### Installed Postgres

I simply used standard distribution package.

```bash
sudo apt install postgresql postgresql-contrib
```

Change `/etc/postgresql/*/main/postgresql.conf` to set `listen_addresses` to `*` (listen on all ip).

Change `/etc/postgresql/*/main/pg_hba.conf` to add:
```ini
# IPv4 local network connections:
host    all             all             10.0.0.1/8            md5
```

and restart postgresql

### create off user

On off1 we get user info:

```bash
sudo -u postgres pg_dumpall --globals-only   |less
...
CREATE ROLE off;
ALTER ROLE off WITH NOSUPERUSER INHERIT NOCREATEROLE NOCREATEDB LOGIN NOREPLICATION NOBYPASSRLS PASSWORD '******';
...
```

And we take relevant line to create off user in the container using `sudo -u postgres psql`.

### testing database restore

On off1, I did a dump of postgres minion database:

```bash
sudo -u postgres pg_dump -d minion --format=custom --file /tmp/$(date -Is -u)-minion.dump
```

On off2, we scp the file and restore it:

```bash
sudo scp 10.0.0.1:/tmp/2023-08-21T21:41:09+00:00-minion.dump /zfs-hdd/pve/subvol-120-disk-0/var/tmp/
```

and in the container:
```bash
sudo -u postgres pg_restore --create --clean -d postgres /var/tmp/2023-08-21T21:41:09+00:00-minion.dump
```
We have two errors, but they are expected.

## installing a memcached container

### Creating the container

I created a CT for OFF followings [How to create a new Container](../proxmox.md#how-to-create-a-new-container) it went all smooth.

It's 121 (off-memcached)
I choosed a 15Gb disk on zfs-hdd, 0B swap, 2 Cores and 4 Gb memory.

I also [configure postfix](../mail.md#postfix-configuration) and tested it.

I did not create a user.

### installing memcached

Inside container:

```bash
apt install memcached
```

### adding off-infrastructure repository

```bash
sudo ssh-keygen -f /root/.ssh/github_off-infra -t ed25519 -C "root-off-memcached-off-infra@openfoodfacts.org"
sudo vim /root/.ssh/config
...
# deploy key for openfoodfacts-infra
Host github.com-off-infra
        Hostname github.com
        IdentityFile=/root/.ssh/github_off-infra
...
cat /root/.ssh/github_off-infra.pub
```

Go to github add the off pub key for off to [off infra repository](https://github.com/openfoodfacts/openfoodfacts-infrastructure/settings/keys) with write access.

Then clone repo in /opt:
```bash
git clone git@github.com-off-infra:openfoodfacts/openfoodfacts-infrastructure.git /opt/openfoodfacts-infrastructure
```

### configuring memcached

We will use the file in git:

```bash
rm /etc/memcached.conf
ln -s /opt/openfoodfacts-infrastructure/confs/off-memcached/memcached.conf /etc/
systemctl restart memcached
```


## Putting data in zfs datasets

### fixing a syslog bug

In syslog I saw a lot of `zfs error: cannot open 'zfs-nvme/pve': dataset does not exist`

I decided to fix it by creating this dataset:
```bash
zfs create zfs-nvme/pve
```


### creating datasets

Products and images datasets are already there, we create the other datasets.
We also create a dataset for logs as they are big on off.

```bash
SERVICE=off
zfs create zfs-hdd/$SERVICE/cache
zfs create zfs-hdd/$SERVICE/html_data
zfs create zfs-hdd/$SERVICE/logs
```
same for `off-pro`

but also created `images` for `off-pro`

```bash
zfs create zfs-hdd/off-pro/images
```

and change permissions:

```bash
sudo chown 1000:1000  /zfs-hdd/off{,-pro}/{,html_data,images,cache,logs}
```

We also need to create off/orgs
```bash
zfs create zfs-hdd/off/orgs
sudo chown 1000:1000  /zfs-hdd/off/orgs
```


### adding to sanoid conf

We do it asap, as we need some snapshots to be able to use syncoid later on.

We edit sanoid.conf to put our new datasets with `use_template=prod_data`.

We can launch the service immediately if we want: `systemctl start sanoid.service`


### Moving products to vme zfs

#### creating datasets

Because of problems at server install, we have the products in `zfs-hdd` datasets while, at least for off and off-pro, we want them in `zfs-nvme`. This will improve performances.

So we will move products there.
To do this:

On off2, we create the new zfs datasets:
```bash
zfs create zfs-nvme/off
zfs create zfs-nvme/off/products
zfs create zfs-nvme/off-pro
zfs create zfs-nvme/off-pro/products
```

#### disabling sync

On off1, we temporarily disable sync to off2 by editing `$REMOTE` in `sto-products-sync.sh`.

On off1 we verify no send  to off2 is in progress `ps -elf|grep zfs.send`

#### copying datasets

On off2, we sync the `zfs-hdd` datasets to the `zfs-nvme` ones:
```bash
SERVICE=off
# get first and last snapshot
zfs list -t snap zfs-hdd/$SERVICE/products
zfs-hdd/off/products@20230417-0000  7.93G      -      300G  -
...
zfs-hdd/off/products@20230719-0930     0B      -      317G  -

# TIP from Christian Quest:
# * on sending side, use "-w" to send raw data (avoid compression etc.),
# * on receiving side, use -s to be able to restart from where you stopped if needed

# send first snapshot, this took about 5 hours (damn me, I didn't add the timeâ€¦)
time zfs send -w zfs-hdd/$SERVICE/products@20230417-0000 | pv | zfs recv zfs-nvme/$SERVICE/products -s -F
# send all snapshots incrementally
time zfs send -w -I 20230417-0000 zfs-hdd/$SERVICE/products@20230719-0930 | pv | zfs recv zfs-nvme/$SERVICE/products -s
```

We do the same for `off-pro` (this time first snapshot was `20230418-0000` and last was `20230719-0930`)

#### enabling sync again

On off1, we change the  `sto-products-sync.sh`

* adding off2 IP back to`$REMOTE`
* using zfs-nvme instead of zfs-hdd

After some time we verify it's working.

#### changing containers mount points

As we did this operation, the lxc configuration for 113 and 114 where still using zfs-hdd mount points, we changed them to zfs-nvme for products.


### migrating root datasets on ovh3

If we want to synchronize off and off-pro root dataset, they have to be created by syncing from off2 to ovh3.
But as they already exists on ovh3, we have to create them, move products in them, and swap the old and the new one (avoiding doing so during a sync).

#### prepare

Verify which datasets exists under the old root datasets on ovh3:

```bash
$ zfs list -r rpool/off{,-pro}
NAME                        USED  AVAIL     REFER  MOUNTPOINT
rpool/off                  13.9T  21.8T      272K  /rpool/off
rpool/off-pro              34.2G  21.8T      216K  /rpool/off-pro
rpool/off-pro/products     34.2G  21.8T     25.0G  /rpool/off-pro/products
rpool/off/clones           1.89G  21.8T      224K  /rpool/off/clones
rpool/off/clones/images    1.22G  21.8T     10.1T  /rpool/off/clones/images
rpool/off/clones/orgs       272K  21.8T     51.4M  /rpool/off/clones/orgs
rpool/off/clones/products   678M  21.8T      411G  /rpool/off/clones/products
rpool/off/clones/users     5.32M  21.8T     3.10G  /rpool/off/clones/users
rpool/off/images           12.0T  21.8T     10.6T  /rpool/off/images
rpool/off/orgs             58.0M  21.8T     54.2M  /rpool/off/orgs
rpool/off/products         1.88T  21.8T      430G  /rpool/off/products
rpool/off/users            5.20G  21.8T     3.18G  /rpool/off/users
```

So we have to move products for off-pro, and for off we have to move products, images.

`users` and `orgs` are just rsynced backup from off1, so we don't have to move them, we will just keep them until we re-create the clones that use them.

The problem now will be to pass between ZFS synchronizations.

#### create new target datasets
On off2:

```bash
sudo syncoid --no-sync-snap zfs-hdd/off  root@ovh3.openfoodfacts.org:rpool/off-new
sudo syncoid --no-sync-snap zfs-hdd/off-pro  root@ovh3.openfoodfacts.org:rpool/off-pro-new
```
it's very fast.

#### move off-pro products to new dataset and swap datasets
on ovh3, we wait to have no off-pro sync running.

```bash
zfs rename rpool/off{,-new}/products && \
zfs rename rpool/off-pro{,-old} && \
zfs rename rpool/off-pro{-new,}
```
zfs-hdd/off/cache       140K  23.9T      140K  /zfs-hdd/off/cache
zfs-hdd/off/html_data   140K  23.9T      140K  /zfs-hdd/off/html_data
zfs-hdd/off/images     11.4T  23.9T     10.3T  /zfs-hdd/off/images
zfs-hdd/off/logs        140K  23.9T      140K  /zfs-hdd/off/logs
zfs-hdd/off/orgs        140K  23.9T      140K  /zfs-hdd/off/orgs
zfs-hdd/off/products    898G  23.9T      317G  /zfs-hdd/off/products
zfs-hdd/off/users      3.73G  23.9T     2.32G  /zfs-hdd/off/users

#### moving off products and images to new dataset and swapping

As sync are taking a lot of time on products and images, we will disable them until we do the moveâ€¦

On off2, temporarily edit `/etc/sanoid/syncoid-args.conf` to remove the line corresponding to images.
On off1, temporarily edit `sto-products-sync.sh` and disable ovh3 target.

Wait until current syncs finishes (sto-products-sync.sh run newer than config change on off1 and syncoid run newer than config change on off2).

Because of clones, we also have to shutdown the off staging container which use those datasets. On off staging container (on ovh1):
```bash
cd /home/off/off-net/
sudo -u off docker-compose stop
```

And remove clones on ovh3:

```bash
# need this to clean stalled NFS connections
systemctl restart nfs-server.service
zfs destroy rpool/off/clones/users
zfs destroy rpool/off/clones/products
zfs destroy rpool/off/clones/orgs
```

Then we do the move on ovh3:
```bash
zfs rename rpool/off{,-new}/products && \
zfs rename rpool/off{,-new}/images && \
zfs rename rpool/off{,-new}/clones && \
zfs rename rpool/off{,-old} && \
zfs rename rpool/off{-new,}
```

Now we can re-enable syncoid on off2 and sto-products-sync off1.


#### Recreating clones

**IMPORTANT**: Before re-creating users and orgs and recreating clones, I follow the step to add users and orgs to syncoid and rsync users and orgs from prod (so that we have something worthful) (see [copying users and orgs](#copying-users-and-orgs)).

I created the `off/clones` dataset and enable NFS share.
```bash
zfs create rpool/off/clones
zfs set sharenfs="rw=@10.0.0.1/32,rw=@10.1.0.200/32,no_root_squash" rpool/off/clones
```
Then I manually created the clones following the `maj-clones-nfs-VM-dockers.sh` script.

I then restart the docker compose on off-net.


#### setup sync

We can now sync them regularly by editing `/etc/sanoid/syncoid-args.conf`:

```ini
# off
--no-sync-snap zfs-hdd/opf root@ovh3.openfoodfacts.org:rpool/opf
# off-pro
--no-sync-snap zfs-hdd/$SERVICE root@ovh3.openfoodfacts.org:rpool/$SERVICE
```

I also added it to `sanoid.conf` ovh3, but using synced template.



### Copying users and orgs

I already have setup syncoid on off2 to sync users and orgs to ovh3:

On off2 (in a screen), as root:

```bash
time rsync --info=progress2 -a -x 10.0.0.1:/srv/off/users  /zfs-hdd/off/users && \
time rsync --info=progress2 -a -x 10.0.0.1:/srv/off/orgs  /zfs-hdd/off/orgs
```
this took a few minutes.

I was lucky enough that syncoid just started at this very moment and let it finish.

After checking sync did happen correctly (`zfs list -t snap rpool/off/{orgs,users} && ls rpool/off/{orgs,users}`), we can also remove old `users` and `orgs` from the old off dataset on ovh3:
```bash
zfs destroy rpool/off-old/{users,orgs}
```
and as they were the last, also removed `rpool/off-old`

I also decided to temporarily do a regular rsync of users and orgs through a cron on off1.

I added it to root crontab on off1:

```ini
# rsync users and orgs to off2 every hour
48 * * * *\trsync -a /srv/off/users/ 10.0.0.2:/zfs-hdd/off/users/; rsync -a /srv/off/orgs/ 10.0.0.2:/zfs-hdd/off/orgs/
```

### Copying off-pro images

```bash
time rsync --info=progress2 -a -x 10.0.0.1:/srv2/off-pro/html/images/products /zfs-hdd/off-pro/images/
```

### Copying other data


I rsync cache data and other data on ofF2:

```bash
# cache
time rsync --info=progress2 -a -x 10.0.0.1:/srv/off/{build-cache,tmp,debug,new_images} /zfs-hdd/off/cache/ ;\
echo "== data folders (shared with off-pro)" ; \
time rsync --info=progress2 -a -x 10.0.0.1:/srv/off/data /zfs-hdd/off/ ;\
echo "== other data" ; \
time rsync --info=progress2 -a -x 10.0.0.1:/srv/off/{deleted.images,deleted_products,deleted_products_images} /zfs-hdd/off/ ;\
echo "== imports for off" ; \
time rsync --info=progress2 -a -x 10.0.0.1:/srv2/off/imports /zfs-hdd/off/ ;\
echo "== translations for off" ; \
time rsync --info=progress2 -a -x 10.0.0.1:/srv/off/translate /zfs-hdd/off/ ;\
echo "== reverted_products on off" ; \
time rsync --info=progress2 -a -x 10.0.0.1:/srv/off/reverted_products /zfs-hdd/off/ ;\
echo "== html/data" ; \
time rsync --info=progress2 -a -x 10.0.0.1:/srv/off/html/data/ /zfs-hdd/off/html_data ;\
time rsync --info=progress2 -a -x 10.0.0.1:/srv/off/html/{files,exports} /zfs-hdd/off/html_data/ ;\
time rsync --info=progress2 -a -x 10.0.0.1:/srv2/off/html/dump /zfs-hdd/off/html_data/ ;\
date
```

off-pro:

```bash
date ; \
echo "== pro images" ; \
time rsync --info=progress2 -a -x 10.0.0.1:/srv2/off-pro/html/images/products /zfs-hdd/off-pro/images/ ;\
echo "== some cache folders" ; \
time rsync --info=progress2 -a -x 10.0.0.1:/srv/off-pro/{build-cache,tmp,debug} /zfs-hdd/off-pro/cache/ ;\
echo "== other data" ; \
time rsync --info=progress2 -a -x 10.0.0.1:/srv/off-pro/{deleted.images,deleted_private_products} /zfs-hdd/off-pro/ ;\
echo "== html/data" ; \
time rsync --info=progress2 -a -x 10.0.0.1:/srv/off-pro/html/data/ /zfs-hdd/off-pro/html_data ;\
time rsync --info=progress2 -a -x 10.0.0.1:/srv/off-pro/html/files /zfs-hdd/off-pro/html_data/ ;\
echo "== sftp" ; \
time rsync -a --info=progress2 10.0.0.1:/srv/sftp/ /zfs-hdd/off-pro/sftp/ ;\
echo "== sugar" ; \
time rsync -a 10.0.0.1:/srv/sugar/logs/sugar_log /zfs-hdd/off/data/sugar/old_sugar_log ;\
date
```

This took a bit more than 6 hours on 2023-11-22.

Don't forget to also change ownership if needed

```bash
chown -R 1000:1000 /zfs-hdd/off{,-pro}/cache
```

### Procedure for switch of off and off-pro from off1 to off2

**NOTE**: we do both in a row because we don't want to deal with NFS for off / off-pro communication

**WARNING**: finish writing it before running it !!!


1. change TTL to a low value in DNS
  * **DONE** for openfoodfacts domains (including pro)
  * for madenear.me madenear.me.uk cestemballepresdechezvous and all other domains
  * for howmuchsugar.in combiendesucres.fr and all other domains

1. update the product to latest changes in `/srv/off` or `/srv/off-pro` and `/srv/openfoodfacts-web`

1. Redeploy the dist of off and off-pro on off2

1. verify differences between Config2 files (for off and off-pro) between off1 and off
   * I had to add `query_url` which is new

1. restart:

   * on off: `sudo systemctl restart apache2.service nginx.service cloud_vision_ocr@off.service minion@off.service`
   * on off-pro: `sudo systemctl restart apache2.service nginx.service cloud_vision_ocr@off-pro.service minion@off-pro.service`

1. do a last test:
   * I had to redo a `sudo cpanm --notest --quiet --skip-satisfied --installdeps .`
   * I forgot to run the build_lang and build_taxonomies scriptsâ€¦
   * problem on pro platform for products without barcode: `internal_code.sto` not accessible on pro platform


1. shutdown:
   * off on **off2** `sudo systemctl stop apache2 nginx`
   * off-pro on **off2** `sudo systemctl stop apache2 nginx`

1. on off1 comment users and orgs rsync in crontab

1. Rync all data (on off2):
   see above  [Rsync data](#rsync-data)
```

# 2023-04-27 Moving Docker Staging to OVH1

See [issue #217](https://github.com/openfoodfacts/openfoodfacts-infrastructure/issues/217)

## The Task

We have latency problems from ovh2 to ovh3 which makes using nfs mounts for off-net impractical.
I thought we could move the datasets clones to ovh2 (#216) but it's not feasible: disks are 1T too small and the products dataset is 1.5T (I did misread the size).

But while ovh2 is 10ms away from ovh3, ovh1 is only 0.12ms away (this is a 100 fold), so if we move the 200 VM to ovh1, we would be able to use nfs volumes from ovh3.

The task: move some services from ovh1 to ovh2 and move the 200 VM to ovh1.

## Proposal

Initial proposal to make the switch and keep disk space well dispatched:

* We move from ovh2 -> ovh1

  * 200 (294G) dockers-staging

* We could move ovh2 -> ovh1 (for a total of 234G!)

  * 111 (96G) wild ecoscore - *should we remove instead?*
  * 120 (64G) mongo-test - *to be removed? YES*
  * 108 (32G) folksonomy
  * 112 (42G) connect-staging

## Doing It

I did synchronize storage of 200 on ovh1 before migration but now disk is full !

I underestimated the size (as it's a block storage, I should have considered max size (322G) instead of real size (294G)).

Also I got a difference between what proxmox console shows on ovh1 (Usage 98.23% (940.04 GB of 956.97 G)) and `zpool list` command:
``` sh
rpool   920G   886G  33.8G        -         -    76%    96%  1.00x    ONLINE  -
```

I did move more containers:

* 106 (51.54G) mirabelle
* 110 (45G) crm
* 103 (34G) mastodon

Still after that, monitoring was in bad shape, and also ZFS on ovh1 was too high.

So I moved monitoring VM 203 to ovh2.

Although I'm a bit sad that now monitoring is on same machine as prod dockers (200).

## Changing Route

(Update on 2023-05-12)

Something was missing! In fact we were still using the original host as gateway, thus having latency even higher!

I had to manually change the default route for VM that I moved (staging and monitoring):

* Edited `/etc/network/interfaces` to change gateway to the new host internal address (`10.0.0.x`)
* In a screen (to prevent ssh connection loss between commands!):
  ```bash
  ip route del default via 10.0.0.2 dev ens18 onlink ; ip route add default via 10.0.0.1 dev ens18 onlink
  ```
   (or the other way around for VM 203)

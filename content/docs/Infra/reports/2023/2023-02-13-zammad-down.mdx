# 2023-02-13 Zammad down

## Symptom

Symptom: 502 Bad gateway on https://support.openfoodfacts.org/

## Investigation

Using systemctl status I see that :

```bash
$ systemctl status zammad-web-1.service
● zammad-web-1.service
   Loaded: loaded (/etc/systemd/system/zammad-web-1.service; enabled; vendor preset: enabled)
   Active: failed (Result: exit-code) since Mon 2023-02-13 09:43:14 UTC; 33s ago
  Process: 137673 ExecStart=/usr/bin/zammad run web (code=exited, status=1/FAILURE)
 Main PID: 137673 (code=exited, status=1/FAILURE)
```

Trying a restart, is not working.

```bash
$ systemctl status zammad-web-1.service
● zammad-web-1.service
   Loaded: loaded (/etc/systemd/system/zammad-web-1.service; enabled; vendor preset: enabled)
   Active: failed (Result: exit-code) since Mon 2023-02-13 09:44:27 UTC; 49s ago
  Process: 137995 ExecStart=/usr/bin/zammad run web (code=exited, status=1/FAILURE)
 Main PID: 137995 (code=exited, status=1/FAILURE)

févr. 13 09:44:27 off-zammad systemd[1]: Failed to start zammad-web-1.service.
```

Looking at logs I see:

```bash
$ journalctl -u zammad-web-1.service -r

févr. 13 09:44:27 off-zammad zammad-web-1.service[137995]: Exiting
févr. 13 09:44:27 off-zammad zammad-web-1.service[137995]: A server is already running. Check /opt/zammad/tmp/pids/server.pid.
févr. 13 09:44:27 off-zammad zammad-web-1.service[137995]: => Run `rails server --help` for more startup options
févr. 13 09:44:27 off-zammad zammad-web-1.service[137995]: => Rails 6.0.4.6 application starting in production
févr. 13 09:44:27 off-zammad zammad-web-1.service[137995]: => Booting Puma
```

Looking at  `/opt/zammad/tmp/pids/server`, the pid is 156 which does not correspond to a zammad process:
```bash
ps -elf|grep 156
0 S root         156       1  0  80   0 - 71564 sys_po févr.12 ?     00:00:00 /usr/lib/accountsservice/accounts-daemon
```

I don't see any zombie process corresponding to zammad with `ps -elf`

## Resolution

So I decided to remove the PID file and relaunch:

```bash
rm /opt/zammad/tmp/pids/server.pid
systemctl restart zammad-web-1.service
```

## Conclusion

uptime is `14:25:43 up 16:43,  1 user,  load average: 3,17, 3,39, 3,95`
\+ I have no syslog on 22 february from 00:30 until 21:40.

The most probable cause for me is that there has been a hard shutdown with no time to remove the pid file. And has the pid was a small number, it was taken by a system process.

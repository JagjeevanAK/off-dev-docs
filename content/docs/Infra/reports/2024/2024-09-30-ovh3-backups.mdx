title: "OVH3 Backups (Wrong Approach)"
description: "This report details a failed approach to OVH3 backups, highlighting the challenges of replicating ZFS datasets with existing Proxmox replication. It covers attempts to integrate Sanoid snapshots and synchronize with MOJI, along with side fixes for stalled VM replication and old volume removal."

**VERY IMPORTANT:** this approach does not work and at the time of writing, we are on the way to change the way we do it.


We need an intervention to change a disk on ovh3.

We still have very few backups for OVH services.

Before the operation, I want to at least have replication of OVH backups on the new MOJI server.

Ideally I would like to use sanoid for every kind of backups, but I don't want to disrupt the current setup, as I don't have the time to.

What I wanted to do:
* add sanoid managed snapshots to current volumes replications of ovh1 / ovh2 containers and VMs
* add sanoid managed snapshots to current volumes ovh3 containers + add a backup of ovh3 system (it's not on ZFS)
* synchronize all those ZFS to MOJI, it may need some tweaking because of the replication snapshot, which should not be replicated.

This is not feasible ! Because of the replication. The replication must start from last replication snapshot and cannot be done in reverse.


What we can do instead:
* add sanoid snapshots on the ovh1 / ovh2 servers
* let replication of the container sync those snapshots to ovh3
* keep very few snapshots (1 or 2) on the ovh1/ ovh2 side (we have very few space left)
* keep snapshots for longer on the ovh3 side

## Moving replication to a pve sub dataset (abandonned)

**NOTE:** finally **not done**, because I didn't succeed to make it work, and was not really confident about the procedure.

Currently we have a replication landing in `/rpool`, 
this is annoying because it does not enable to configure sanoid
using recursive property (which would also ensure new volumes are under sanoid control).
So I would like to move them to pve.


To do this:
- first, 106 replication was stalled for a long time, I deleted the replication job and re-created it.
- Using the interface, I first disabled replication of all vm containers to ovh3.
  It can also be done using `pvesr disable <id>`
- I also stopped the two containers on ovh3 (100 (Munin) and 150 (gdrive-backup)).

- I then created a new dataset: `zfs create rpool/pve`
- Then I changed  `/etc/pve/storage.cfg` to change the pool and mountpoint of the rpool storage
- I tried to move a first replication by using `zfs rename` to move a subvol from `rpool` to `rpool/pve` and then re-enabled the replicationâ€¦ but it failed with a zfs allow/unallow error. 
- As I was not able to understand the error (there was no particular allowed user before (as showned by `zfs allow rpool`)), **I stepped back**:
  - disable replication on the container where I did re-enabled it
  - rename the volume back to a child of `rpool`
  - restored `/etc/pve/storage.cfg` to its original state



## Adding sanoid snapshots to replicated volumes

## Adding sanoid on ovh1 and ovh2

I installed sanoid using the .deb that was on ovh3:
```bash
apt install libcapture-tiny-perl libconfig-inifiles-perl pv lzop mbuffer build-essential git
dpkg -i /opt/sanoid_2.2.0_all.deb
```

I then:
* created the email on failure unit
* personalized the sanoid systemctl unit

```bash
cd /opt/openfoodfacts-infrastructure/confs/$HOSTNAME
mkdir -p systemd/system
cd systemd/system
ln -s ../../../common/systemd/system/email-failures\@.service .
ln -s ../../../common/systemd/system/sanoid.service.d .

ln -s /opt/openfoodfacts-infrastructure/confs/$HOSTNAME/systemd/system/email-failures\@.service /etc/systemd/system
ln -s /opt/openfoodfacts-infrastructure/confs/$HOSTNAME/systemd/system/sanoid.service.d /etc/systemd/system
systemctl daemon-reload
```

Then I added the sanoid.conf telling to snapshot the volumes but keeping only 2 snapshots
and snapshot once an hour.

Then we activate:
```bash
ln -s /opt/openfoodfacts-infrastructure/confs/$HOSTNAME/sanoid/sanoid.conf /etc/sanoid/
systemctl enable --now sanoid.timer
```

## Configuring sanoid on ovh3

On ovh3 we want to keep more snapshots than on ovh1 and ovh2.
So we configure sanoid to do so.

## Syncing to MOJI

On Moji, we don't currently sync data from ovh3.

I [setup an operator account](../sanoid.md#how-to-setup-synchronization-without-using-root) on ovh3 for moji.

Created the syncoid-args.conf file.

I did a first sync using:
```bash
grep -v "^#" syncoid-args.conf | while read -a sync_args;do [[ -n "$sync_args" ]] && time syncoid  "${sync_args[@]}" </dev/null;done
```

Setup syncoid service and timer, and enable them.

## Side fix: fixing vm 200 replication

VM 200 (docker staging) was stalled on ovh1.

I tried to remove the replication job but it failed.
To remove it I did:
`pvesr delete 200-0 -force`
and it worked.

I then recreated the replication job.

## Side fix: removing old volumes

There are volumes remaining on ovh3 of containers that were deleted.

To get an idea of the container it was from, I can cat the `/etc/hostname`. 
For example, for container 112:
```bash
cat /rpool/subvol-112-disk-0/etc/hostname 
mongo2
```

```bash
for num in 109 115 116 117 119 120 122;do echo $num; cat /rpool/subvol-$num-disk-0/etc/hostname;done
109
slack
115
robotoff-dev
116
mongo-dev
117
tensorflow-xp
119
robotoff-net
120
impact-estimator
122
off-net2
``

I did destroy the following volumes:
```bash
# slack
zfs destroy rpool/subvol-109-disk-0 -r
# mongo2
zfs destroy rpool/subvol-112-disk-0 -r
# robotoff-dev
zfs destroy rpool/subvol-115-disk-0 -r
# mongo-dev
zfs destroy rpool/subvol-116-disk-0 -r
# tensorflow-xp
zfs destroy rpool/subvol-117-disk-0 -r
# robotoff-net
zfs destroy rpool/subvol-119-disk-0 -r
# impact estimator
zfs destroy rpool/subvol-120-disk-0 -r
# off-net2
zfs destroy rpool/subvol-122-disk-0 -r
```

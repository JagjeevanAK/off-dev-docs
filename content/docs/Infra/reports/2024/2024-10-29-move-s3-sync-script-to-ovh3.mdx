The script used to synchronize images to AWS S3 (through AWS S3 Open Dataset program) was run on off2 server.
This server is overloaded (due to I/O), so we now run this script on the OVH3 server (that has a replicate of images through Sanoid snapshots).

OVH3 server has Python 3.7, and the script requires at least Python 3.9. I wanted to install pyenv using the off user, but I didn't manage to get pyenv working with dash, which is the default shell for off user.

As a result, I install [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) on ovh3 as a replacement, for `off` user:


```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

`uv` is installed automatically in `/home/off/.cargo/bin/uv`.

Install Python 3.11:

```bash
uv python install 3.11
```

I moved S3 synchronization script to openfood facts infra repository, in the `scripts` directory ([commit](https://github.com/openfoodfacts/openfoodfacts-infrastructure/commit/42dd4fcdb1f52d55767f33136bc94a6590fa4fd8)).

Note that Python version and dependencies can be directly declared at the top of the Python script, as comment:

```python
# /// script
# dependencies = [
# "openfoodfacts==1.1.5",
# "orjson==3.10.7",
# "boto3==1.35.32",
# "tqdm==4.66.5",
# ]
# requires-python = ">=3.9"
# ///
```

I also copied the aws credentials in `~/.aws/credentials` on ovh3 server (`off` user).

when launching the script with `uv run sync_s3_images.py`, `uv` automatically creates a virtualenv if needed, install the dependencies and run the script in the virtual environment.

I installed the systemd service and timer on ovh3, and disabled the systemd service/timer on off2 server.

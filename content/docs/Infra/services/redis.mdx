# Redis Usage

Redis is a versatile database that acts as a synchronization layer between different services in our infrastructure.

<Callout type="info">
We use Redis in various places across the Open Food Facts infrastructure for caching, event streaming, and inter-service communication.
</Callout>

## Redis Deployments

## Production Instance for OFF

We have a production instance of Redis dedicated to Open Food Facts operations.

<Callout type="note">
Currently used for the event stream function to enable other services like off-queries, Robotoff, and search-a-licious to update their data.
</Callout>

### Cross-Datacenter Access

<Steps>
  <Step>
    **Stunnel Proxy**
    
    Redis is proxied between OVH and Free datacenter through [stunnel](./stunnel.md).
  </Step>
  
  <Step>
    **Connection from OVH**
    
    To use from ovh1/ovh2, connect to stunnel client server on standard Redis port:
    
    ```bash title="Redis Connection"
    # Connect to Redis through stunnel
    redis-cli -h 10.1.0.113 -p 6379
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

    ### Container Deployment
    
    - **Location**: Container 122 on the OFF Proxmox cluster
    - **Data Storage**: `/var/lib/redis` is in a specific dataset
    - **OS**: Simple Debian deployment
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab value="configuration" label="Configuration">
    ### Configuration Management
    
    <Callout type="tip">
    Specific configurations are stored in `confs/off-redis` directory.
    </Callout>
    
    **System Service**:
    - Override systemd service to send emails on failure
    - Automated monitoring and alerting
  </Tab>

## Matomo Integration

<Callout type="info">
[Matomo also uses Redis Queues](./matomo.md) to handle high traffic volumes efficiently.
</Callout>

<Steps>
  <Step>
    **Queue Processing**
    
    Redis manages analytics data queues for Matomo.
  </Step>
  
  <Step>
    **Traffic Management**
    
    Handles high-volume analytics data processing.
  </Step>
</Steps>

# Infrastructure Overview

## Server Locations

<Callout title="Hosting Providers">
We have servers hosted by multiple providers, with generous sponsorship from key organizations.
</Callout>

### Sponsored Infrastructure

  <Card title="Moji Datacenter" href="./moji-datacenter" description="High-performance server sponsored by Moji" />
</Cards>

#### Free Datacenter Servers
- **off1.openfoodfacts.org** - Main Open Food Facts production server
- **off2.openfoodfacts.org** - Database and backend services

#### OVH Foundation Servers
- **ovh1.openfoodfacts.org** - Proxmox cluster, small services
- **ovh2.openfoodfacts.org** - Docker services (staging/production)

## Network Architecture

### Web Traffic Proxies

<Steps>
<Step>
### OVH Services Proxy
Most services are hosted on OVH and pass through an nginx proxy (see [proxmox - HTTP Reverse Proxy](./proxmox#http-reverse-proxy)) hosted on VM 101 on ovh1 which has a bridge with its own IP.
</Step>

<Step>
### Product Opener Proxy
Product opener instances (openfoodfacts.org and its cousins) have their own proxy on [off1](#off1).
</Step>

<Step>
### Static Content Proxy
A specific nginx is also set on [ovh3](#ovh3) to serve images and some static resources.
</Step>
</Steps>

### Network Services

<Cards>
  <Card title="Stunnel" description="For clear text TCP services transiting through (also to avoid IP rules)" />
  <Card title="IP Tables" description="Access control and service proxying" />
</Cards>

#### Access Control
<Callout type="info" title="IP Tables Rules">
We limit access to certain services through IP tables rules:
- **off2**: MongoDB access filtered by IP to enable access from OVH
- **ovh1**: IP tables rules proxy PGM service requests from off1 and off2
</Callout>

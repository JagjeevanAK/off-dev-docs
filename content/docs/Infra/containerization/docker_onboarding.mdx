# Docker Onboarding

<Callout type="info">
Focusing on the developer onboarding process into a project is a very important step to make a repository popular: no one wants to struggle for hours to setup an application and start developing on it.
</Callout>

A streamlined and easy setup process is thus critical to having meaningful contributions on an open-source repository.

## Rules of the OFF Onboarding Process

The setup steps should be as simple as possible and stick by the following rules:

<Cards>
<Card title="Respect the User's Time">
- Reduce the amount of time needed to setup a project to the least amount possible
- Make it as fast as possible to take into account code modifications (ideally live reload, if needed a container restart)
</Card>

<Card title="Accessibility for Non-Developers">
Make it easy for non-developers to contribute: the dev setup should not require a high comprehension of the application at hand
</Card>

<Card title="Repeatable and Tested Workflow">
The dev setup should be automated and tested with every pull request to ensure that it does not break accidentally when making changes
</Card>

<Card title="Wide Platform Support">
Try to make the dev deployment platform agnostic, at least for commands used to develop in a normal process
</Card>
</Cards>

<Callout type="tip">
**Platform Compatibility Note:**
On Windows, git comes with *git bash* which should be privileged as a console. You can use symlink on Windows.
</Callout>

<Callout type="note">
The `make dev` command should work across all repos to streamline the applications setup process.

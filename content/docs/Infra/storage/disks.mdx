# Disk Management

## Best Practices

<Callout type="tip">
Always try to separate: primary data, cache data (data generated from primary data), configuration data, and system. This makes data management (backup, recovery, day to day maintenance) easier.
</Callout>

<Cards>
<Card title="Data Separation">
Separate primary data, cache data, configuration data, and system data for easier management
</Card>
<Card title="ZFS Datasets">
In ZFS use different datasets for different types of data
</Card>
<Card title="NFS for Large Data">
For backup data or large data with few I/O operations eventually use NFS mount from a separate server

## Health Monitoring with Smartctl

Some useful commands for disk health monitoring:

<Callout type="info">
```bash title="Complete Disk Information"
smartctl -x
```
This gives you every information about a system.
</Callout>

### Key Health Indicators

<Steps>
<Step>
**Overall Health Assessment**
Be attentive to `SMART overall-health self-assessment test result`.
</Step>

<Step>
**Error Count Verification**
Also verify `Device Error Count`. (you can see errors with `smartctl -l error`)
</Step>

<Step>
**Self-Test Results**
Verify that tests under `SMART Extended Self-test` finished. (you can see tests with `smartctl -l selftest`)
</Step>

<Step>
**Manual Testing**
Use `smartctl -t short /dev/sdX` to test a single device. (or `-t long`)
</Step>
</Steps>

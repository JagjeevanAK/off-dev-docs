# Dev Install

You may choose Docker install (recommended, less chance to mess up with your system, all included) or local install.

    ## Docker Install

    <Steps>
      <Step>
        ### Clone and Setup Environment
        
        After cloning the repository, customize parameters by editing the `.env` file.
        You should consider these changes:

        - If you want to use ML models, add `docker/ml.yml` to `COMPOSE_FILE`, using `;` as separator.
          You should also run `make dl-models` to download all machine learning models locally.
        - Change `OFF_UID` and `OFF_GID` to match your own user UID/GID (optional, only if you experience file permission issues)

        <Callout type="warn">
          **Important:** Beware not to commit your local changes to `.env` file!
        </Callout>

        <Callout type="info">
          For file permission issues, see [Getting developer uid for docker](https://gist.github.com/alexgarel/6e6158ee869d6db2192e0441fd58576e)
        </Callout>
      </Step>

      <Step>
        ### Configure Elasticsearch
        
        Because of Elasticsearch service, you may need to increase a system parameter (`vm.max_map_count=262144`), as described in the [Elasticsearch documentation](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/vm-max-map-count.html).
      </Step>

      <Step>
        ### Build and Run
        
        Simply run:

        ```bash title="Start development environment"
        make dev
        ```

        This will build containers, pull images based containers, create containers and run them.
      </Step>

      <Step>
        ### Verify Installation
        
        Verify whether robotoff is running as expected, by executing the following command in CLI:
        
        ```bash title="Check Robotoff status"
        curl http://localhost:5500/api/v1/status
        ```
        
        The expected response is `{"status":"running"}`.

        <Callout type="info">
          Also take a look at [maintenance](./maintenance.md) for ongoing maintenance tasks.
        </Callout>
      </Step>
    </Steps>
  </Tab>

  <Tab value="Local Install">
    ## Local Install with Poetry

    This is an alternative if you are reluctant to use Docker, or have some other reasons to prefer manual install.

    <Steps>
      <Step>
        ### Setup Poetry
        
        After cloning the repository:
        1. Make sure a [recent version of Poetry is installed](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation)
        2. Configure Poetry to use Python 3.11:
           ```bash title="Configure Python version"
           poetry env use python3.11
           ```
      </Step>

      <Step>
        ### Install Dependencies
        
        Install the dependencies:

        ```bash title="Install dependencies"
        poetry install
        ```
      </Step>

      <Step>
        ### Configure Test Files
        
        Configure files required for the tests to run locally:

        Compile the i18n files:
        ```bash title="Compile i18n files"
        cd i18n && bash compile.sh && cd ..
        ```
      </Step>

      <Step>
        ### Database Configuration
        
        Configure your settings to point to your dev postgresql database (that you should have installed the way you want)

        <Callout type="info">
          If you want to use Elasticsearch predictions, you'll also have to set up an Elasticsearch instance
        </Callout>
      </Step>

      <Step>
        ### Debugging in Container
        
        To debug in a running container, you need to run poetry in the container. For example:

        ```bash title="Debug in container"
        docker compose run --rm api poetry run python
        ```
        
        Here we run the `api` service. This opens a Python command prompt, you may debug with [pdb](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pdb.html) or play with the code.

## Restore DB Dumps

To have real-world data, you're probably interested in restoring data from production server.

<Cards>
  <Card title="PostgreSQL Dump" description="Main database restore process" />
  <Card title="MongoDB Dump" description="Product data restore process" />
</Cards>

### PostgreSQL Dump

Robotoff uses PostgreSQL as main database.

<Steps>
  <Step>
    ### Download Database Dump
    
    First, download the latest DB dump:

    ```bash title="Download PostgreSQL dump"
    wget https://openfoodfacts.org/data/dumps/robotoff_postgres_latest.dump
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Start Container and Copy Dump
    
    Start PostgreSQL container and copy the dump inside the container:

    ```bash title="Start PostgreSQL and copy dump"
    make up service=postgres
    docker cp -a robotoff_postgres_latest.dump robotoff_postgres_1:/tmp/
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Restore Database
    
    Then launch dump restore:

    ```bash title="Restore PostgreSQL database"
    docker exec -it robotoff_postgres_1 pg_restore -v -d postgres -U postgres -c -j 8 --if-exists /tmp/robotoff_postgres_latest.dump
    ```

    <Callout type="warn">
      This command drops all existing tables (`-c` command) and performs restore using 8 cores. The database is huge, it may take several hours to run depending on your hardware.
    </Callout>
  </Step>
</Steps>

### MongoDB Dump

Robotoff also relies on MongoDB to fetch product data. On staging and production, it interacts directly with the same MongoDB instance used by Product Opener.

<Steps>
  <Step>
    ### Download and Extract Archive
    
    To restore Product Opener MongoDB dump, start by downloading and extracting the archive:

    ```bash title="Download and extract MongoDB dump"
    wget https://static.openfoodfacts.org/data/openfoodfacts-mongodbdump.tar.gz
    tar xvzf openfoodfacts-mongodbdump.tar.gz
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Start Container and Copy Dump
    
    Make sure the MongoDB container is up and running and copy the dump directory inside the container:

    ```bash title="Start MongoDB and copy dump"
    make up service=mongodb
    docker cp -a dump robotoff_mongodb_1:/var/tmp/
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Restore Database
    
    Then launch dump restore:

    ```bash title="Restore MongoDB database"
    docker exec -it robotoff_mongodb_1 mongorestore --drop /var/tmp/dump
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

# Nutrition Photo Selection

<Callout title="Objective">
Every product should have a nutrition photo selected if nutrition facts are visible on the packaging. For multilingual products, we only want a nutrition table to be selected for the main language of the product to avoid unnecessary image duplication, except in the rare cases where we have distinct table for different languages.
</Callout>

## Detection Methods

We detect nutrition tables using a combination of approaches:

    description="Using ML models to identify nutrition-related content"
  />
</Cards>

### Nutrient Detection Insights

We use two types of insights to identify nutrition content:

<Steps>
<Step>
### Nutrient Mention Insights
We use `nutrient_mention` insights [^nutrient_mention_insight] to fetch all nutrient mentions, in all supported languages:

- **Nutrient names**: "sugar", "carbohydrates", "nutritional information", "energy", etc.
- **Nutrient values**: Numeric values with units
</Step>

<Step>
### Nutrient Insights
We also use `nutrient` insights [^nutrient_insight], that detect nutrient name and values that are consecutive in the OCR string, to assign a higher priority to images that also have `nutrient` insights in addition to `nutrient_mention` insights (`priority=1` instead of `priority=2`).
</Step>
</Steps>

## Selection Criteria

The detected nutrient names are associated with one or more language (ex: if we detect 'energie', it may be in French, German or Dutch). We check for each image and each detected language if the following rules apply, in which case the image is a candidate for selection as a nutrition table photo [^nutrition_image_importer]:

<Callout title="Candidate Requirements">
All of the following conditions must be met:
</Callout>

- **Nutrient names**: At least 4 nutrient name mentions ("sugar", "energy",...) in the target language
- **Nutrient values**: At least 3 nutrient value mentions ("15 g", "252 kJ",...)
- **Energy values**: At least one energy nutrient value (value ending with "kJ" or "kcal")
- **Language match**: The detected language must be the product main language

## Object Detection Integration

<Card
  title="Nutrition Table Cropping"
  description="If available, we use the nutrition-table object detector prediction to find a crop of the nutrition table. We only use the cropping information if there is only one nutrition table detected with confidence â‰¥0.9."
/>

## Insight Generation

<Steps>
<Step>
### Condition Check
If all the selection criteria apply, we generate an insight.
</Step>

<Step>
### Uniqueness
There is maximum one insight generated per product.
</Step>

<Step>
### Prioritization
We generate candidates using the most recent images first (images are sorted by decreasing image IDs), so that the most recent images are considered first: we want the most up-to-date photo possible for nutrition table.
</Step>
</Steps>

# Contributing

Contributions are welcome, and they are greatly appreciated! Every little bit helps, and credit will always be given.

You can contribute in many ways:

## Types of Contributions

<Cards>
  <Card title="Report Bugs" href="https://github.com/openfoodfacts/robotoff/issues" description="Help us improve by reporting issues you encounter" />
  <Card title="Fix Bugs" description="Look through GitHub issues tagged with 'bug' and 'help wanted'" />
  <Card title="Implement Features" description="Take on enhancement requests tagged with 'help wanted'" />
  <Card title="Write Documentation" description="Improve official docs or add docstrings to code" />
  <Card title="Submit Feedback" description="Propose new features or improvements" />
</Cards>

### Report Bugs

Report bugs at [https://github.com/openfoodfacts/robotoff/issues](https://github.com/openfoodfacts/robotoff/issues).

<Callout type="info">
  When reporting a bug, please include:
  - Your operating system name and version
  - Any details about your local setup that might be helpful in troubleshooting
  - Detailed steps to reproduce the bug
</Callout>

### Fix Bugs

Look through the Github issues for bugs. Anything tagged with "bug" and "help wanted" is open to whoever wants to implement it. Issues tagged with "good first issue" are suitable for newcomers.

### Implement Features

Look through the Github issues for features. Anything tagged with "enhancement" and "help wanted" is open to whoever wants to implement it.

### Write Documentation

Robotoff could always use more documentation, whether as part of the official [Robotoff docs](https://github.com/openfoodfacts/robotoff/tree/main/doc) or in docstrings.

### Submit Feedback

The best way to send feedback is to file an issue at [https://github.com/openfoodfacts/robotoff/issues](https://github.com/openfoodfacts/robotoff/issues).

<Callout type="note">
  If you are proposing a feature:
  - Explain in detail how it would work
  - Keep the scope as narrow as possible, to make it easier to implement
  - Remember that this is a volunteer-driven project, and that contributions are welcome
</Callout>

## Get Started!

Ready to contribute code? Here's how to set up Robotoff for local development.

<Steps>
  <Step>
    ### Fork and Clone
    
    Fork the robotoff repo on Github, then clone your fork locally:

    ```bash title="Clone your fork"
    git clone git@github.com:your_name_here/robotoff.git
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Setup Git LFS
    
    Robotoff uses git lfs to store binary files necessary for it to work. To setup git lfs:

    1. Install [git lfs](https://git-lfs.com/)
    2. Go to `robotoff` directory and setup git lfs with `git lfs install`. This only has to be done once.
    3. Fetch LFS files with `git lfs fetch && git lfs checkout`
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Choose Installation Method
    
    Choose between [docker install (recommended) or local install](../how-to-guides/deployment/dev-install.md) and run it.
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Start Coding!
    
    Make your changes to the codebase.
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Run Tests and Checks
    
    When you're done making changes, check that your changes pass flake8, mypy and the tests. In addition, ensure that your code is formatted using black:

    <Callout type="warn">
      If you are on Windows, make sure you have [Make for Windows](http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/make.htm) installed. Don't forget to add its path in your [system environment variables](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44272416/how-to-add-a-folder-to-path-environment-variable-in-windows-10-with-screensho/44272417#44272417).
      
      A sample path may look like this: `C:\Program Files (x86)\GnuWin32\bin`
      
      It is recommended to use Window's default command prompt instead of Power shell for smooth installation.
    </Callout>

    **If using Docker:**

    ```bash title="Run tests with Docker"
    make lint
    make checks
    make tests
    ```
    
    To test the APIs on your localhost:

    ```bash title="Start services"
    docker compose up
    ```

    <Callout type="info">
      You can make a POST request through [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) or simply paste the URL in a web browser to make a GET request like this one: http://localhost:5500/api/v1/insights/
      
      The mapping of functions and API path is at the end of `robotoff/app/api.py`
    </Callout>

    **If using local install:**

    ```bash title="Run tests locally"
    flake8
    black --check .
    mypy .
    isort --check .
    poetry run pytest tests
    ```

    <Callout type="warn">
      Before running the test cases make sure you have a database created. Have a look at `.env` and `robotoff/settings.py` - the default database name, user, and password is: `postgres`
      
      Configure them through environment (you may use `.env` if you use docker) as you like. See [dev install](../how-to-guides/deployment/dev-install.md) for more information about how to restore database dumps.
    </Callout>
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Commit and Push Changes
    
    Commit your changes and push your branch to Github:

    ```bash title="Commit and push changes"
    git status
    git add files-you-have-modified
    git commit -m "fix: your detailed description of your changes"
    git push origin name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature
    ```

    <Callout type="info">
      **Commit Message Guidelines:**
      - We follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) specification, please prefix your commit messages with `fix:`, `feat:`,...
      - Always contain a subject line which briefly describes the changes made. For example "docs: update CONTRIBUTING.rst"
      - Subject lines should not exceed 50 characters
      - The commit body should contain context about the change - how the code worked before, how it works now and why you decided to solve the issue in the way you did

  </Step>
</Steps>

## Pull Request Guidelines

Before you submit a pull request, check that it meets these guidelines:

<Callout type="warn">
  **Requirements:**
  1. The pull request should include tests
  2. If the pull request adds functionality, the docs should be updated. Put your new functionality into a function with a docstring
  3. The pull request should work for Python 3.11. Check [https://github.com/openfoodfacts/robotoff/actions](https://github.com/openfoodfacts/robotoff/actions) and make sure that the tests pass for all supported Python versions

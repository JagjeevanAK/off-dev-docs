# Product Opener Interactions

<Callout title="Integration Overview">
Robotoff mainly interacts with Product Opener (Open Food Facts backend service) through three means:
</Callout>

<Cards>
  <Card title="Redis Notifications" description="Receives updates when products are created/modified/deleted or images uploaded" />
  <Card title="MongoDB Access" description="Direct read/write access to the underlying MongoDB database" />
  <Card title="API Calls" description="Calls Product Opener API to update/delete products and images" />
</Cards>

## Redis Notification

### Product Update Events

A new event is published on the `product_updates_off` Redis stream whenever a product is updated or deleted.

<Callout title="Event Fields">
This event contains the following fields:
</Callout>

- **`code`**: the barcode of the product
- **`action`**: the action performed, either `updated` or `deleted`. Image upload uses the `updated` action
- **`flavor`**: the flavor (`off`, `obf`, `opff`, `off_pro`)
- **`user_id`**: the user ID that performed the action
- **`comment`**: the user comment associated with the action
- **`diffs`**: the differences between the old and new product data
- **`product_type`**: the product type (`food`, `petfood`, `beauty`,...)

#### Processing Updated Events

<Steps>
<Step>
### Category Prediction
Predict categories and import category predictions/insights.
</Step>

<Step>
### Name-based Predictions
Generate and import predictions/insights from product name (regex/flashtext-based).
</Step>

<Step>
### Insight Refresh
Refresh all insights for this product (i.e: import all predictions again, and update insight table accordingly).
</Step>
</Steps>

### Image Upload Events

Uploaded images trigger an `updated` event, with the following diffs:

```json title="Image Upload Event"
{
    "uploaded_images": {
        "add": ["1"]
    }
}
```

<Callout type="info">
With `1` being the ID of the uploaded image.
</Callout>

#### Processing Image Events

After receiving this event, Robotoff performs the following [^image_import]:

<Steps>
<Step>
### Image Metadata
Save the image metadata in the `Image` DB table.
</Step>

<Step>
### Insight Import
Import insights from the image.
</Step>

<Step>
### Logo Detection
Run logo detection pipeline on the image.
</Step>
</Steps>

#### Insight Import Process

<Callout title="Import Steps">
Insight import includes the following steps:
</Callout>

- **OCR Processing**: Extract and import regex/flashtext predictions and insights from the image OCR
- **Nutriscore Detection**: Run the nutriscore object detection model, if the "NUTRISCORE" string was detected in the OCR text (to avoid wasting compute resources and preventing false positive results)
- **Logo Pipeline**: Run logo detection pipeline: detect logos using the object detection models, generate embeddings from logo crops and index them in the Elasticsearch ANN index

## MongoDB Interaction

<Callout title="Direct Database Access">
Robotoff often needs to access the latest information about product. As the API is sometimes unresponsive, Robotoff has a direct access to the MongoDB.
</Callout>

### Read Access

<Card title="Product Data" description="Used to fetch the product data in the products collection for real-time information access" />

### Write Access

<Callout type="info" title="Facet Addition">
Robotoff also has a write access, that allows it to add facets dynamically. This process is done every night; only the `en:missing-nutrition-facts-fibers-present-on-photos` quality facet is currently added by Robotoff.
</Callout>

## Product Opener API

<Callout title="Direct API Integration">
Robotoff also interacts directly with Product Opener through its API. Everytime an insight is annotated (`annotation=1`), either manually or automatically, Robotoff calls Product Opener API to perform the associated action (update the product, delete an image,...).
</Callout>

### Static Resources

Robotoff also depends on static resources from Product Opener:

<Cards>
  <Card title="Taxonomy Files" description="Downloaded and cached in RAM (e.g., categories.full.json)" />
  <Card title="JSONL Dump" description="Used to scan entire database and update predictions/insights without full MongoDB scan" />
  <Card title="Images/OCR Files" description="Image and OCR processing resources" />
</Cards>

#### Resource Details

<Steps>
<Step>
### Taxonomy Files
Example: `https://static.openfoodfacts.org/data/taxonomies/categories.full.json` - downloaded and cached in RAM.
</Step>

<Step>
### Database Dump
The JSONL dump: `https://static.openfoodfacts.org/data/openfoodfacts-products.jsonl.gz` - used to scan the entire database and update predictions/insights without having to do a full MongoDB scan.
</Step>

<Step>
### Media Resources
Images and OCR files for processing and analysis.
</Step>
</Steps>

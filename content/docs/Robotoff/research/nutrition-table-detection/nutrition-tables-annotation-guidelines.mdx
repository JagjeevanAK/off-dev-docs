# Nutrition Table Annotation Guidelines

Guidelines on what and how to label.

<Callout type="info">
  Adapted from [PASCAL VOC 2011 Guidelines](http://host.robots.ox.ac.uk/pascal/VOC/voc2011/guidelines.html)
</Callout>

## What to Label

All objects of the defined categories, unless:

<Callout type="warn">
  **Exceptions:**
  - You are unsure what the object is
  - The object is very small (at your discretion)
  - Less than 10-20% of the object is visible, such that you cannot be sure what class it is
</Callout>

### Bounding Box Rules

<Cards>
  <Card title="Visible Area" description="Mark the bounding box of the visible area of the object (not the estimated total extent)" />
  <Card title="Complete Coverage" description="Bounding box should contain all visible pixels" />
  <Card title="Tight Fit" description="The bounding box should enclose the object as tight as possible" />
</Cards>

### Special Cases

**Clothing/Mud/Snow**
If an object is 'occluded' by a close-fitting occluder (e.g., clothing, mud, snow), then the occluder should be treated as part of the object.

**Transparency**
- ✅ **Do label** objects visible through glass
- ❌ **Treat reflections** on the glass as occlusion

**Mirrors**
- ✅ **Do label** objects in mirrors

**Pictures**
- ✅ **Label objects** in pictures/posters/signs only if they are photorealistic
- ❌ **Do not label** cartoons, symbols, etc.

## Guidelines on Categorization

<Cards>
  <Card 
    title="nutrition-table" 
    description="A table containing nutrition facts"
  />
  <Card 
    title="nutrition-table-text" 
    description="Variant where nutrition facts are not displayed in a table. Ex: 'Nutritional facts for 100g: Energy - 252 kJ, fat: 12g,...'"
  />
  <Card 
    title="nutrition-table-small-energy" 
    description="Symbol often found on the front image indicating kJ/kcal of a portion/100g. Bounding box should only enclose the symbol, not additional texts around it"
  />
  <Card 
    title="nutrition-table-small" 
    description="Pack of symbols often found on front image indicating nutrition facts. Use this if other nutritional information are laid out next to the object"
  />
</Cards>

<Callout type="info">
  **Multiple Tables**: If there are several nutrition-table or nutrition-table-text on the image (often found on multilingual products), label each object separately.
</Callout>

<Callout type="warn">
  **Important**: For nutrition-table-small-energy, do not use this label if other nutritional information are laid out next to the object - use nutrition-table-small instead.
</Callout>

<Callout type="info">
This guide will help you set up your local development environment for Search-a-licious.
</Callout>

<Steps>
<Step title="Prerequisites">

First, follow the same [prerequisites as for normal installation](../users/how-to-install.mdx#prerequisites):

<Cards>
<Card title="mmap Count" description="Configure system mmap count for Elasticsearch" />
<Card title="Docker Setup" description="Install Docker and Docker Compose" />
</Cards>

</Step>
<Step title="Install Development Tools">

### Pre-commit

<Callout>
We use pre-commit to check the code quality.
</Callout>

<Card title="Pre-commit Installation" href="https://pre-commit.com/#install">
Follow the official tutorial to install pre-commit on your machine
</Card>

### Direnv

<Callout type="tip">
Direnv is a tool to automatically set environment variables depending on the current directory. This is handy to personalize the environment for each project as environment variables have priority over the `.env` file.
</Callout>

<Card title="Direnv Tutorial" href="https://openfoodfacts.github.io/openfoodfacts-server/dev/how-to-use-direnv/">
For Linux and macOS users, follow our tutorial to install direnv^[winEnvrc]
</Card>

</Step>
<Step title="Environment Setup">

<Callout type="info">
**Environment Configuration Options**

You have several options to set up your environment:
1. Use direnv with the `.envrc` file (recommended)
2. Add a `.envrc` that you source in your terminal (recommended)
3. Modify the `.env` file directly (not recommended for development)
</Callout>

The following steps are for the recommended options. If you edit the `.env` directly, ignore the "export " keywords.

**Get your user information:**

```bash title="Get User IDs"
id -u  # for USER_UID
id -g  # for USER_GID
```

**Create `.envrc` file:**

Add a `.envrc` file at the root of the project:

```bash title="Environment Configuration"
export USER_GID=<your_user_gid>
export USER_UID=<your_user_uid>

export CONFIG_PATH=data/config/openfoodfacts.yml
export OFF_API_URL=https://world.openfoodfacts.org
export ALLOWED_ORIGINS='http://localhost,http://127.0.0.1'
```

<Callout type="tip">
^[winEnvrc]: For Windows users, the .envrc is only taken into account by the `make` commands.
</Callout>

</Step>
<Step title="Build Containers">

To build the containers, run the following command:

```bash title="Build Development Containers"
make build
```

Note: the Makefile will align the user id with your own uid for a smooth editing experience (having same user id in container and host, so that you have permission to edit files).

## Running

Now you can run the project with Docker `docker compose up `.

After that run the following command on another shell to compile the project:

```bash title="Watch TypeScript Compilation"
make tsc_watch
```

<Callout type="tip">
Do this for next installation steps and to run the project.
</Callout>

<Callout type="warning">
**Common Issues**

- **Permission Error**: If your user is not part of the `docker` group, you should either [add it](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/#manage-docker-as-a-non-root-user) or modify the Makefile to prefix `sudo` to all docker and docker compose commands.
- **Update Container Crash**: Container crashes because we are not connected to Redis, this is not a problem for development.
</Callout>

</Step>
<Step title="Verify Installation">

Docker spins up several services:

<Cards>
<Card title="Elasticsearch" description="Two nodes, one exposed on port 9200 - test at http://127.0.0.1:9200" />
<Card title="Elasticvue" description="Management UI on port 8080 - test at http://127.0.0.1:8080" />
<Card title="Search Service" description="API and UI on port 8000" />
</Cards>

**Test the services:**
- API: http://search.localhost:8000/docs
- UI: http://search.localhost:8000/

<Callout type="tip">
By default we only expose on the localhost interface. This is driven by the `*_EXPOSE` variables in `.env`.
</Callout>

**Congratulations, you have successfully installed the project!**

</Step>
<Step title="Import Development Data">

You will need to import data from a JSONL dump:

**Import Taxonomies:**

```bash title="Import Taxonomies"
make import-taxonomies
```

**Import Products:**

```bash title="Import Sample Products"
# Get some sample data
curl https://world.openfoodfacts.org/data/exports/products.random-modulo-10000.jsonl.gz --output data/products.random-modulo-10000.jsonl.gz
gzip -d data/products.random-modulo-10000.jsonl.gz

# Import data (skip updates because we're not connected to Redis)
make import-dataset filepath='products.random-modulo-10000.jsonl' args='--skip-updates'
```

**Verify your data:** Visit http://search.localhost:8000/

</Step>
<Step title="Explore Data">

<Callout>
When you need to explore the Elasticsearch data, you can use Elasticvue.
</Callout>

1. Go to http://127.0.0.1:8080/welcome
2. Click on "Add Elasticsearch cluster"
3. Change the cluster name to "docker-cluster" at http://127.0.0.1:9200
4. Click on "Connect"

</Step>

## Core Principles

<Steps>
<Step title="Best-in-Class Stack">

A very good stack with best in class open source components (see docker compose files)

</Step>
<Step title="Powerful API">

A very powerful API that is capable and easy to use. This is achieved through:
- Use of Lucene Query Language
- Abstracting complex processing under the hood (synonyms, language support, aggregations, etc.)

</Step>
<Step title="Simple Configuration">

A single, easy to use configuration file to declare your data structure and what you need to search

</Step>
<Step title="Flexible UI Components">

Web components to quickly build UIs while still being able to customize them in many scenarios

</Step>
</Steps>

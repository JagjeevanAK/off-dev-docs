# Tutorial - Using Search-a-licious in Your Project

<Callout>
So you have a dataset, or a project, with a collection of data you want to make searchable. Search-a-licious can help you have it done in a matter of few hours, while retaining your choices.
</Callout>

In this tutorial, we will see how we can use search-a-licious to search Open Food Facts data.

<Steps>
<Step title="Setting Up">

### Clone the Repository

As an easy way to setup the project we will clone the repository:

```bash title="Clone Repository"
git clone git@github.com:openfoodfacts/search-a-licious.git
cd search-a-licious
```

</Step>
<Step title="Create Configuration File">

We need to create a configuration file to indicate which fields we care about in our index.

For this we can create a `conf/data/openfoodfacts-tutorial.yml` file. It uses the [YAML format](https://yaml.org/).

### Default Index and Indices

At the top we have:

```yaml title="Basic Index Configuration"
default_index: "off" # see 2
indices:  # see 1
  off:    # see 2
```

<Callout type="info">
**Multi-Dataset Support**

1. Search-a-licious supports serving more than one dataset at once, each dataset has its own indice with its own definition. So we start with the "indices" keyword.

2. We must give a name to our unique index. Let's call it `off` as Open Food Facts. We also indicate that this is the default index for the API.
</Callout>

### Index Configuration

Now comes important indications for the index:

```yaml title="Index Settings"
...
indices:
  off:
    index:  # see 1
      id_field_name: code  # see 2
      last_modified_field_name: last_modified_t  # see 2
      name: openfoodfacts  # see 3
```

<Callout type="info">
**Index Configuration Details**

1. The index section marks settings that are specific to the index.
2. We have to indicate two important fields:
   - A field that contains a unique id for each item in the collection (the identifier). In Open Food Facts dataset, it's simply the barcode, stored in `code`
   - A field that contains the item modification date to enable incremental updates. In Open Food Facts dataset, it's `last_modified_t`
3. We have to give a sensible name to the index, which should be unique for our ElasticSearch instance. So we simply put "openfoodfacts".
</Callout>

</Step>
<Step title="Configure Searchable Fields">

Let's continue with configuration of fields we want to be able to search:

```yaml title="Field Configuration"
...
indices:
  off:
    ...
    fields:  # see 1
      code:  # see 2
        required: true
        type: keyword
      product_name:  # see 3
        full_text_search: true
        type: text_lang
      labels_tags:  # see 4
        type: keyword
        taxonomy_name: label
        bucket_agg: true
      labels:  # see 5
        full_text_search: true
        input_field: labels_tags
        taxonomy_name: label
        type: taxonomy
      nutriscore_grade:  # see 6
        type: keyword
        bucket_agg: true
      last_modified_t:  # see 7
        type: date
```

1. Now we are in the field section
2. Code is our identifier, it contains the barcode:
   - We mark it required for we should reject elements without it (it's certainly a bug)
   - Each field must have a type which indicates how to handle it
   - For the code we choose the type `keyword` which means it's a fixed token
3. product_name is also an important field:
   - This time we want to be able to search part of it, also it's a field that comes with different values for different languages, that's why we mark it as `type: text_lang`
   - We also include this field in free text search, that's the `full_text_search: true` part
4. `labels_tags` is a field that contains labels of the product in a canonical form:
   - This is a field supported by a taxonomy. Taxonomies give translations and synonyms for terms of a specific field of interest. In this case this is the `label` taxonomy
   - This field will be useful to find all items matching a particular label in a precise way, using the label canonical form
   - Also we plan to use the field for facets so we put the `bucket_agg: true` part
5. The labels repeat information from `labels_tags` (hence the `input_field: labels_tags`) but is there to enrich the information of full text searches (`type: taxonomy`). With that, the full text search will take into account the translations and synonyms of labels
6. Nutri-Score is a field with very basic values: "a", "b", ..., "e", "unknown" and "not-applicable", as for code, a perfect case for a `keyword` field
7. last_modified_t, corresponding to last modification time, is an example of a date field

</Step>
<Step title="Configure Taxonomies">

### Taxonomy Configuration

Taxonomies will be used in multiple ways by Search-a-licious:

<Cards>
<Card title="Synonyms Support" description="Add synonyms for taxonomized values on full text search (e.g., search for 'European Organic' to find 'EU Organic' label)" />
<Card title="Autocomplete" description="Suggest values to search for in autocomplete (can also be used in edit forms)" />
<Card title="Translation" description="Translate values from the results, for example as we display facets" />
</Cards>

```yaml title="Taxonomy Configuration"
...
indices:
  off:
    ...
    taxonomy:
      sources:  # see 1
      - name: label
        url: https://static.openfoodfacts.org/data/taxonomies/labels.full.json
      exported_langs:   # see 2
      - en
      - fr
      index:   # see 3
        name: off_taxonomy
```

<Callout type="info">
**Taxonomy Configuration Details**

1. We cited one taxonomy above: `label`, here we define how to get it
2. We must also define which languages we want to use for this taxonomy. There is some trade-off between having a manageable size for the index and supporting more languages
3. Finally we have to give a name to the Elasticsearch index that will contain the taxonomies
</Callout>

### Supported Languages

```yaml title="Language Configuration"
...
indices:
  off:
    ...
    supported_langs: ["en", "fr"]
    lang_separator: "_"
```

<Callout type="tip">
**Language Configuration**

1. The list of supported languages tells which languages will be retained in our index
2. The "lang separator" helps us tell that the fields are suffixed by the language using this separator. In our case it means, for example, that `product_name_fr` contains the French version of `product_name`
</Callout>

<Callout type="success">
We have our configuration ready. That was a bit tough, but this was the hardest part!
</Callout>

<Card title="Configuration Reference" href="./ref-config.md">
Don't hesitate to read the Reference for Configuration file to learn more
</Card>

</Step>
<Step title="Setup the Project">

### Environment Configuration

In the project you can modify the `.env` file and change variables you need to change, but for now, the only mandatory variable to change is the one that will point to our configuration file.

```ini title="Environment Configuration"
...
# Path to the yaml configuration file
# This envvar is **required**
CONFIG_PATH=`data/config/openfoodfacts.yml`
```

<Card title="Settings Reference" href="./ref-settings.md">
See the Reference for Settings to learn about other settings
</Card>

</Step>
<Step title="Initial Import">

### Getting the Data

<Callout>
Now that it's all done, we are ready to start to import the data.
</Callout>

First we start the Elasticsearch index, we will also start the ElasticVue service to be able to look at what happens:

```bash title="Start Elasticsearch Services"
docker compose up -d es01 es02 elasticvue
```

<Callout type="info">
There is an export of all the openfoodfacts data in JSONL available at https://static.openfoodfacts.org/data. But it's a very big file! For this tutorial we will prefer to use a sample of products.
</Callout>

Put this file in the data/ directory which is bind mounted in the container:

```bash title="Download Sample Data"
wget https://static.openfoodfacts.org/data/exports/products.random-modulo-10000.jsonl.gz -O data/products.random-modulo-10000.jsonl.gz
```

### Import Process

<Steps>
<Step title="Import Product Data">

We will then import this file in our index, we have a specific command for that:

```bash title="Import Products"
docker compose run --rm api python3 -m app import /opt/search/data/products.random-modulo-10000.jsonl --skip-updates
```

<Callout type="tip">
**Command Breakdown**

- The first part is simply to run a command using our docker container
- The `python3 -m app import` part is to run the `import` command provided by our `app` module
- We use the `--skip-updates` flag because we don't have a redis stream to connect to, to look for updates
</Callout>

</Step>
<Step title="Import Taxonomies">

We also need our taxonomy, and there is a command `import-taxonomies` to get it:

```bash title="Import Taxonomies"
docker compose run --rm api python3 -m app import-taxonomies
```

</Step>
</Steps>

<Card title="Detailed Import Guide" href="./how-to-update-index.md#first-import">
You can read more about this process in the How to update index documentation
</Card>


### Inspecting Elasticsearch

We can take a look at what just happened by using ElasticVue, a simple but handy tool to inspect Elasticsearch.

<Steps>
<Step title="Open ElasticVue">

Open http://127.0.0.1:8080 in your browser.

</Step>
<Step title="Connect to Cluster">

If it's the first time, click "ADD ELASTICSEARCH CLUSTER" and use:
- **Authorization**: No authorization
- **Cluster name**: docker-cluster  
- **URI**: http://localhost:9200

</Step>
<Step title="View Indices">

Click on the button which says there are 3 indices.

You shall see two indices:
- One named `openfoodfacts-<date of initial import>` with alias `openfoodfacts`
- One named `off_taxonomy-<date of initial import>` with alias `off_taxonomy`

As you already guessed, the first contains our food products, and the second our taxonomies.

</Step>
</Steps>

![Our two indices in ElasticVue](../assets/tutorial-elasticvue-indices-after-import.png "Our two indices in ElasticVue")

<Callout type="tip">
The "Lucene docs" column gives you an idea of the number of entries you have in each index. You can click on an index to view its content and have a feeling of what we just imported.
</Callout>

</Step>
<Step title="Using the Search API">

### Starting the Service

<Callout>
We don't have an interface to search at the moment, but we can use the API.
</Callout>

<Callout type="info">
It would be perfectly ok to only deploy the interface, maybe because you will call it from your own application either to provide search to your users, or to implement a very specific feature which is based upon a search request.
</Callout>

Let's start our search-a-licious service:

```bash title="Start Search Services"
docker compose up es01 es02 api frontend
```

### Running Your First Query

We start the `api` container, which is the search-a-licious backend, and the frontend as it is an nginx acting as a reverse proxy.

<Callout type="tip">
Now let's open http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs

You can see the documentation of the various API offered by search-a-licious service.
</Callout>

Let's concentrate on the **GET** `/search` service. We can test it using the **Try it out** button.

We can try a simple search of **fair trade** in the q parameter, we get 17 results.

### Understanding API Response

Interesting fields in the JSON we receive include:

<Cards>
<Card title="hits" description="The detail of each result. In each result we retrieve full information about an item, that's a lot of data. We might optimize this using the fields query parameter." />
<Card title="page" description="The current returned page, page_count the number of pages, and page_size the number of results per page." />
<Card title="count" description="The total number of items returned. is_count_exact, when false indicates that for performance reasons, we did not compute the total number of results, but there are at least count results." />
</Cards>

### API Features

<Steps>
<Step title="Sorting Results">

As you get the results you might want them according to a particular order. Say we search for **fair trade** and we want the results to be sorted by the nutriscore grade.

We simply repeat the above query with:
- `q` = `fair trade` 
- `sort_by` = `nutriscore_grade`

</Step>
<Step title="Limiting Fields">

In the previous example, we might only be interested in the name of the product and its Nutri-Score. We can limit the fields returned by using the `fields` parameter.

Here it would be: `product_name,nutriscore_grade`

</Step>
<Step title="Using Filters">

We may want to be more precise on our request. Now let's ask for products which really have "fair-trade" label.

For this we will use our query field in a more advanced way.

We can use this value for the "q" field: `labels_tags:"en:fair-trade"`

<Callout type="tip">
Using this we specify that we search for the key "en:fair-trade" in the value.^[using-quotes]
</Callout>

#### Advanced Filter Examples

```sh title="Multiple Label Filters"
labels_tags:("en:fair-trade" AND "en:eu-organic")
```

```sh title="OR Filter"
labels_tags:("en:fair-trade" OR "en:eu-organic")
```

```sh title="Combined Search and Filter"
cocoa labels_tags:"en:fair-trade"
```

<Card title="Query Language Guide" href="./explain-query-language.md">
You can find more about the search query syntax in Explain Query Language
</Card>

</Step>
</Steps>

### Working with Facets

<Callout type="info">
Remember in our configuration we added a `bucket_agg: true` on some fields. This will enable us to get facets on those fields.
</Callout>

Let's go back to our API, and use `cocoa labels_tags:"en:fair-trade"` in the request, and ask for facet `nutriscore_grade`. We get a result with same fields as for previous searches, but we have a new `facets` field.

It returns something like:

```json title="Facets Response Example"
"facets": {
  "nutriscore_grade": {
    "name": "nutriscore_grade",
    "items": [
      {
        "key": "e",
        "name": "e", 
        "count": 3,
        "selected": false
      },
      {
        "key": "d",
        "name": "d",
        "count": 2,
        "selected": false
      }
    ],
    "count_error_margin": 0
  }
}
```

<Callout type="tip">
As you can see we have the "nutriscore_grade" facet with two values: "e" and "d", and we got the document count for each value.
</Callout>

<Callout>
The `selected` field was deduced from an analysis of the request. If we were to ask for the `labels_tags` facets with the same request, the `en:fair-trade` label would be selected, as it is an active filter (note that it only works if you write the query in a specific way).
</Callout>

<Callout type="tip">
You can try and ask both facets by using `nutriscore_grade,labels_tags` as the facets parameter.
</Callout>

</Step>
</Steps>

[^using-quotes]: Note that we have to use "" around value here, because the value contains a ":" inside. `labels_tags:en:fair-trade` would be interpreted as asking for a field named labels_tags.en having the value fair-trade.

<Steps>
<Step title="Creating a Search Page using Web Components">

<Callout>
Now that we have played around with the API, we might want to create a search page to let users do their own search in a visual way.
</Callout>

<Callout type="success">
That's where Search-a-licious also got you covered. Search-a-licious provides web components that let you build your search page easily.
</Callout>

### Building a Search Interface

Let's try it and create a static HTML page. We won't care much about the "look and feel" for now, for sake of simplicity.

<Callout type="tip">
A simple way to serve the page is to add a file in the `frontend/public` folder^[devmode]
</Callout>

Let's create a `tutorial.html` file with a very basic initial content:

```html title="tutorial.html - Complete Search Interface"
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Search-a-licious tutorial</title>
    <!-- this makes the various searchalicious components available -->
    <script type="module" src="./search-a-licious.bundled.js"></script>
</head>
<body>
  <div id="search-bar">
  <!-- the search bar where you can add text -->
  <searchalicious-bar></searchalicious-bar>
  <!-- the button to launch the search -->
  <searchalicious-button></searchalicious-button>
  <!-- sorting -->
  <searchalicious-sort auto-refresh>
    <searchalicious-sort-field field="nutriscore_grade">Best nutriscore</searchalicious-sort-field>
    <searchalicious-sort-field field="-nutriscore_grade">Worst nutriscore</searchalicious-sort-field>
  </searchalicious-sort>
  </div>
  <div id="results">
  <!-- display of results -->
  <searchalicious-results>
    <!-- this define a template for results. We can use ${} expression with a result object containing result fields -->
    <template slot="result">
      <li>
        <a href="https://world.openfoodfacts.org/${result.code}">${result.product_name}</a>
        − Nutri-Score: ${result.nutriscore_grade}
      </li>
    </template>
  </searchalicious-results>
  <!-- a small display of the number of results -->
  <searchalicious-count></searchalicious-count>
  <!-- pagination -->
  <searchalicious-pages></searchalicious-pages>
  </div>
</body>
</html>
```

<Callout>
As you can see this is a big file but not so big for a search page.
</Callout>

### Understanding the Components

If you know HTML you should be able to read this quite easily. Let's focus on some elements:

<Steps>
<Step title="Import Library">

First of all we have to import the search-a-licious library to make it available. This is done through the classical `script` element (in `head`), but note the `type="module"` property.

</Step>
<Step title="Search Bar Component">

Next we have the `searchalicious-bar` component. This is the central component. Not only will it be responsible for the input in the search bar, but it also centralizes the search options.

</Step>
<Step title="Search Button">

Then we have the `searchalicious-button`, which, as you guessed, is just responsible for launching the search (hitting enter in the search bar also works, but it might be more evident for some users with a button).

</Step>
<Step title="Sorting Component">

Sorting is a bit more complex, we have the `searchalicious-sort` component, and inside we added the options we want to offer for sorting. The `field` property takes the same value as you would put in the `sort_by` parameter of the search API, and the inner text will be displayed to the user.

</Step>
<Step title="Results Display">

To display our results, we need the `searchalicious-results` component. Inside it we need to define a template, with the property `slot` set to `result`. In this template we can use simple variable interpolation as in a [JavaScript template literal](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Template_literals), with the `result` variable containing one search result, as returned by the API. This will be used to display each result. As the results use a `<ul>` element, it's better to enclose your result in a `<li>`.

</Step>
<Step title="Count and Pagination">

- The `searchalicious-count` component will simply display the number of results
- Finally the `searchalicious-pages` component is there to display a list of pages

</Step>
</Steps>

### Trying Our Interface

Let's try to use it!

<Steps>
<Step title="Access the Interface">

We can go to `http://localhost:8000/static/tutorial.html` and see our interface.

<Callout type="info">
**Screen Capture Placeholder** - Interface will be displayed here
</Callout>

</Step>
<Step title="Basic Search">

We can type `fair trade` in the search bar, hit the search button and see results displayed.

<Callout type="info">
**Screen Capture Placeholder** - Search results will be displayed here
</Callout>

<Card title="Navigation" description="Use the pages navigation to browse all results" />
<Card title="Advanced Search" description="Try a more advanced search like cocoa labels_tags:&quot;en:fair-trade&quot;" />
<Card title="Sorting" description="Test that sorting by best or worst nutriscore is working just fine!" />
</Cards>

</Step>
<Step title="Developer Tools">

<Callout type="tip">
If you are curious, you can open the dev toolbar (F12), go in the network tab, select to only view XHR requests (requests sent by JavaScript), and see how each search is using the search API.
</Callout>

</Step>
</Steps>

[^devmode]: This only works right away if you are using the service in developer mode, which should be the case if you followed this tutorial. Of course in production, this might be served by your own servers.

</Step>
</Steps>

# Explain Configuration File

<Callout type="info">
The idea of Search-a-licious is that you provide all your configurations details in a central file, and all the rest works (at least for main scenarios).
</Callout>

The configuration file is a YAML file.

## One Configuration, Multiple Datasets

<Callout>
A Search-a-licious instance only has one configuration file, but is capable of serving multiple datasets.
</Callout>

It provides a section for each index you want to create (corresponding to a dataset).

<Callout type="tip">
If you have more than one dataset, one must be declared the default (see [default_index](./ref-config/searchalicious-config-schema.html#default_index))
</Callout>

## Main Sections

## Index Configuration

<Callout type="info">
Search-a-licious is really based upon Elasticsearch.
</Callout>

This section provides some important fields to control the way it is used.

<Steps>
<Step title="ID Field Configuration">

`id_field_name` is particularly important as it must contain a field that uniquely identifies each items.

<Callout type="warning">
If you don't have such field, you might use `preprocessor` to compute one. It is important to have such an id to be able to use continuous updates.
</Callout>

</Step>
<Step title="Last Modified Field">

`last_modified_field_name` is also important for continuous updates to decide where to start the event stream processing.

</Step>
</Steps>

## Fields

<Callout type="tip">
This is one of the most important sections.
</Callout>

It specifies what will be stored in your index, which fields will be searchable, and how.

<Callout type="warning">
**Planning Required**

You have to plan in advance how you configure this. Changing this section will probably involve a full re-indexing of all your items.
</Callout>

### Typical Field Configurations

<Steps>
<Step title="Tags Field (Keyword)">

A tags field that has values that are searched as an exact value (aka keyword), e.g., a tag:

```yaml title="Tags Field Configuration"
tags:
    type: keyword
```

</Step>
<Step title="Full Text Search Field">

An ingredients field that is used for full text search when no field is specified:

```yaml title="Full Text Search Configuration"
ingredients:
    type: text
    full_text_search: true
```

</Step>
<Step title="Multilingual Text Field">

A field `product_name` that is used for full text search, but with multilingual support:

```yaml title="Multilingual Field Configuration"
product_name:
    full_text_search: true
    type: text_lang
```

</Step>
<Step title="Integer Field">

A scans_n field is an integer field:

```yaml title="Integer Field Configuration"
scans_n:
    type: integer
```

</Step>
<Step title="Field-Specific Text Search">

A `specific_warnings` field that is used for full text search, but only when you specify the field:

```yaml title="Field-Specific Search Configuration"
specific_warnings:
    type: text
```

</Step>
<Step title="Split Field">

A field brands_tags that needs to be split in multiple values (according to `split_separator` option):

```yaml title="Split Field Configuration"
brands_tags:
    type: keyword
    split: true
```

</Step>
<Step title="Taxonomy Field with Faceting">

A field labels_tags, that is used for exact match but with support of a taxonomy, and that can be used for faceting, and bar graph generation:

```yaml title="Taxonomy Field Configuration"
labels_tags:
    type: keyword
    taxonomy_name: label
    bucket_agg: true
```

</Step>

## Document Fetcher, Pre-processors and Post-processors

<Callout>
It is not always straightforward to index an item.
</Callout>

Search-a-licious offers a way for you to customize some critical operations using Python code.

<Steps>
<Step title="Preprocessor">

Adapts your document before being indexed

</Step>
<Step title="Result Processor">

<Callout type="warning">
Adapts each result returned by a search - keep it lightweight!
</Callout>

</Step>
<Step title="Document Fetcher">

Only used for continuous updates to fetch documents using an API

</Step>
</Steps>

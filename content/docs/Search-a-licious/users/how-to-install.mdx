<Callout type="info">
This guide covers the complete installation process for Search-a-licious, from prerequisites to launching the application.
</Callout>

## Prerequisites

<Steps>
<Step title="Configure mmap Count (Linux Only)">

<Callout type="warning">
**Linux Users Only**

If you are on Linux, you need to make sure that your [system mmap count is high enough for Elasticsearch to run](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/vm-max-map-count.html).
</Callout>

Run the following command:

```bash title="Set mmap Count"
sudo sysctl -w vm.max_map_count=262144
```

**Make it Permanent:**

To make the change permanent, add `vm.max_map_count=262144` to the `/etc/sysctl.conf` file and run:

```bash title="Apply sysctl Changes"
sudo sysctl -p
```

<Callout type="tip">
This ensures that the modified value is retained even after a system reboot. Without this step, the value will reset to its default after reboot.
</Callout>

</Step>
<Step title="Install Docker and Docker Compose">

<Callout>
Search-a-licious uses Docker and Docker Compose to manage the services it needs to run.
</Callout>

<Card title="Docker" href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/" description="Container platform installation guide" />
<Card title="Docker Compose" href="https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/" description="Container orchestration tool" />
</Cards>

Once both are installed, clone the git repository locally.

</Step>
</Steps>

## Configuration

<Callout type="info">
All configuration is passed through environment variables to services using a `.env` file. A sample `.env` file is provided in the repository.
</Callout>

<Steps>
<Step title="Required Configuration">

**Essential Change:** Set the `CONFIG_PATH` variable to the path of your YAML configuration file. This file configures the search-a-licious indexer and search services.

</Step>
<Step title="Production Settings">

<Callout type="warning">
**Production Requirements**

You must configure these settings for production deployment:
</Callout>

<Cards>
<Card title="RESTART_POLICY" description="Change to 'always'" />
<Card title="COMPOSE_FILE" description="Set to 'docker-compose.yml;docker/prod.yml;docker/monitor.yml'" />
<Card title="MEM_LIMIT" description="Set Elasticsearch memory limit" />
<Card title="NGINX_BASIC_AUTH_USER_PASSWD" description="Configure authentication" />
</Cards>

<Callout type="tip">
Monitor is optional but recommended for production deployments.
</Callout>

</Step>
<Step title="Docker Images">

You can either:

**Option 1: Rebuild locally**

```bash title="Build Docker Images"
make build
```

**Option 2: Use GitHub images**

Edit the `.env` file and set `TAG` to the commit SHA corresponding to the version you want to use.

</Step>

<Card title="CI/CD Inspiration" href="https://github.com/openfoodfacts/search-a-licious/blob/main/.github/workflows/container-deploy.yml">
Our CI deployment file might provide useful deployment insights
</Card>

## Launching the Application

<Callout type="tip">
You should now be able to start the Docker services:
</Callout>

```bash title="Start Docker Services"
docker compose up -d
```

<Callout type="warning">
**Common Issues**

- **Permission Error**: If your user is not part of the `docker` group, you should either [add it](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/#manage-docker-as-a-non-root-user) or modify the Makefile to prefix `sudo` to all docker and docker compose commands.

- **Update Container Crashes**: If you are not connected to Redis, Search-a-licious will still run. You need to connect to Redis only if you want continuous updates.

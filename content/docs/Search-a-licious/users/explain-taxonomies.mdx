# Explain Taxonomies

<Callout type="info">
Taxonomies are a way to organize categorization of items.
</Callout>

Normally, a taxonomy is about a specific field. For each possible value, it defines translations in different languages, and also possible synonyms (in each language). For each entry we have a canonical identifier.

<Callout>
A taxonomy also organizes the entries within a direct acyclic graph (a hierarchy but with possibility of multiple parents, though always avoiding cycles). For example, it may help describe that a salmon is a marine fish as well as a freshwater fish, and an oily fish.
</Callout>

<Callout type="tip">
It can be used to help users find items using a specific field, in their language, even if they use a synonym for it.
</Callout>

## Listing Taxonomies

<Card title="Taxonomy Configuration Reference" href="./ref-config/searchalicious-config-schema.html#indices_additionalProperties_taxonomy">
If you plan to use taxonomies, you should first list them in the taxonomy section of the configuration
</Card>

<Callout type="warning">
Taxonomies must come in a JSON format, that can be downloaded at a particular URL.
</Callout>

### JSON Structure

The data in the JSON must contain an object, where:

<Steps>
<Step title="Entry Keys">

Each key corresponds to the id of the taxonomy entries

</Step>
<Step title="Entry Values">

The value is an Object, with the following fields (none are mandatory):

- **`name`**: an Object associating language code, with the entry name in the language (useful for translating the entry)
- **`synonyms`**: an Object associating language code, with an array of synonyms for this entry in this language

</Step>
</Steps>

## Taxonomy Fields

<Card title="Field Configuration Guide" href="./explain-configuration.md#fields">
As you define your fields in the configuration, you can specify that a field is a taxonomy field
</Card>

When you specify `type: taxonomy`, you also have to provide the following fields:

<Cards>
<Card title="taxonomy_name" description="The name of the taxonomy (as defined in the configuration)" />
<Card title="synonyms_search" description="If true, adds a full text subfield that enables using synonyms and translations to match this term" />
</Cards>

## Autocompletion with Taxonomies

<Callout>
When you import taxonomies, they can be used to provide autocompletion in multiple ways.
</Callout>

<Steps>
<Step title="Web Component Integration">

The web components can use them to add values to facets, or to provide suggestions in the search bar.

</Step>
<Step title="API Autocompletion">

<Card title="Autocompletion API" href="../ref-openapi/#operation/taxonomy_autocomplete_autocomplete_get">
You can also use the autocompletion API directly
</Card>

</Step>
</Steps>

## Importing Taxonomies

<Card title="Import Command Reference" href="../devs/ref-python/cli.html#python3-m-app-import-taxonomies">
If you defined taxonomies, you must import them using the import-taxonomies command
</Card>

## Technical Details on Taxonomy Fields

<Callout type="tip">
A taxonomy field is stored in Elasticsearch as an object.
</Callout>

For each language it has a specific field, but in this field we just store the taxonomy entry id (e.g., for organic, we always store `en:organic`). The analyzer is almost set to `keyword` which means it won't be tokenized (but it is not completely true, as we also transform hyphen to underscore).

<Callout type="warning">
**Field Value Requirements**

The value of this field must be considered a unique token by Elasticsearch standard tokenizer. So you should only use letters, numbers, colons and the underscore.
</Callout>
As an exception, we allow the hyphen character, transforming it to "_" before tokenization.

But those field have a specific *search analyzer*, so that when you enter a search query,
The query text is tokenized using standard analyzer, then lower cased, and we then look for synonyms in the taxonomy.

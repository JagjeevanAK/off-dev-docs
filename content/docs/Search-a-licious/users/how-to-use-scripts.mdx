# How to Use Scripts

<Callout type="info">
You can use scripts to sort results in your search requests. It enables providing results that depend upon user-defined preferences.
</Callout>

<Card title="Elasticsearch Script-Based Sorting" href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/sort-search-results.html#script-based-sorting">
This leverages a possibility of Elasticsearch for script-based sorting
</Card>

## Getting Started

<Steps>
<Step title="Declare Scripts">

[Declare the scripts that can be used in the configuration](#declare-the-script-in-the-configuration)

</Step>
<Step title="Import Scripts">

[Import the scripts in Elasticsearch](#import-the-script-in-elasticsearch)

</Step>
<Step title="Use Scripts">

Either use web-components to sort using scripts or call the search API using the script name, and provide parameters

</Step>
</Steps>

## Declare the Script in the Configuration

<Callout>
You have to declare the scripts that can be used for sorting in your configuration.
</Callout>

### Benefits

<Cards>
<Card title="Simple API Calls" description="Keeps the API call simple by just referring to the script by name" />
<Card title="Security" description="More secure as you are in full control of scripts that are allowed to be used" />
</Cards>

### Script Configuration Example

The scripts section can look something like this:

```yaml title="Script Configuration"
scripts:
  personal_score: # see 1
    # see https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/painless/8.14/index.html
    lang: painless  # see 2
    # the script source, here a trivial example
    # see 3
    source: |-
      doc[params["preferred_field"]].size > 0 ? doc[params["preferred_field"]].value : (doc[params["secondary_field"]].size > 0 ? doc[params["secondary_field"]].value : 0)
    # gives an example of parameters
    # see 4
    params:
      preferred_field: "field1"
      secondary_field: "field2"
    # more non editable parameters, can be easier than to declare constants in the script
    # see 5
    static_params:
      param1 : "foo"
```

### Configuration Explanation

<Steps>
<Step title="Script Name">

We declare a script named `personal_score`, this is the name you will use in your API requests and/or web-components attributes

</Step>
<Step title="Script Language">

We declare the language of the script, in this case `painless`. Search-a-licious supports:

<Cards>
<Card title="Painless" href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/modules-scripting-painless.html" />
<Card title="Lucene Expressions" href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/modules-scripting-expression.html" />
</Cards>

</Step>
<Step title="Script Source">

This is the source of the script. It can be a bit tedious to write those scripts. You can use the Elasticsearch documentation to get a better understanding of the language.

<Callout type="tip">
In this example we are using a one liner, but your scripts can be far more complex.
</Callout>

</Step>
<Step title="Parameters">

Parameters are a way to add inputs to the script. You can declare them using an example. You can provide more complex structures, as allowed by JSON. Those parameters will be given through the API requests.

</Step>
<Step title="Static Parameters">

static_params are parameters that are not allowed to change through the API. It's mostly a way to declare constants in the script (hopefully more convenient than declaring them in the script).

</Step>
</Steps>

<Card title="Script Writing Guide" href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/modules-scripting-using.html" description="Introduction to script in Elasticsearch documentation" />
</Cards>

## Import the Scripts in Elasticsearch

<Callout type="warning">
Each time you change the configuration, you have to import the scripts in Elasticsearch.
</Callout>

```bash title="Import Scripts Command"
docker compose run --rm api python -m app sync-scripts
```

## Using Web Components

<Callout>
After you have registered a script, it can be used for sorting using Search-a-licious provided web components.
</Callout>

<Card title="Tutorial Reference" href="./tutorial.md#building-a-search-interface">
We assume that you already have setup a search page, with at least a searchalicious-bar
</Card>

### Component Options

In your [`searchalicious-sort`](./ref-web-components/#searchalicious-sort) component, you can add multiple sort options:

<Cards>
<Card title="searchalicious-sort-field" href="./ref-web-components/#searchalicious-sort-field" description="Add sorting on a field" />
<Card title="searchalicious-sort-script" href="./ref-web-components/#searchalicious-sort-script" description="Add sorting on a script" />
</Cards>

### Script Component Attributes

The `searchalicious-sort-script` component has:

<Steps>
<Step title="Script Name Attribute">

An attribute to set the script name, corresponding to the name you have declared in the configuration

</Step>
<Step title="Parameters Attribute">

An attribute to set the parameters for this sort option. This can be:

- **String**: encoding a JSON Object (if your parameters are in some way static, or you set them through JavaScript)  
- **Local Storage Key**: a key corresponding to a value in the local storage (must be prefixed with `storage:`)

</Step>
</Steps>

### Static Parameters Example

```html title="Static Parameters Usage"
<searchalicious-sort>
  <searchalicious-sort-script
    script="personal_score"
    id="sort-by-quantity"
    parameters='{"preferred_field": "portion_size", "secondary_field": "quantity"}'>
    Sort by portion size (fallback on quantity)
  </searchalicious-sort-script>
  <searchalicious-sort-script
    script="personal_score"
    id="sort-by-nutrition"
    parameters='{"preferred_field": "nutriscore", "secondary_field": "sugar_per_100g"}'>
    Sort by Nutri-Score (fallback on sugar per 100g)
  </searchalicious-sort-script>
</searchalicious-sort>
```

<Callout type="tip">
Using static parameters is an option if you are reusing the same script but for different scenarios. Note that you must provide an `id` to at least one of the sort options because default id is based on script name.
</Callout>

### Dynamic Parameters Example

```html title="Dynamic Parameters Usage"
<searchalicious-sort>
  <searchalicious-sort-script
    script="personal_score"
    parameters='local:personal-score-params'>
    Sort according to my preferences
  </searchalicious-sort-script>
</searchalicious-sort>
```

<Callout>
Using dynamic parameters is an option if you want to let the user choose the field to sort on. The advantage is that it will survive a reload of the page or be still present on another visit.
</Callout>

## Using the Script in the API

<Callout type="info">
You might also want to use the sort by script option in the API.
</Callout>

### API Requirements

<Steps>
<Step title="POST Request">

You must issue a POST request to the `/api/search` endpoint

</Step>
<Step title="JSON Payload">

You must pass a JSON payload with:
- The script name in the `sort_by` property
- You must provide the `sort_params` property with a valid JSON object, corresponding to your parameters

</Step>
</Steps>

### Example API Call

```bash title="API Script Usage Example"
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "sort_by": "personal_score",
    "sort_params": {"preferred_field": "nutriscore", "secondary_field": "sugar_per_100g"}
  }' \
  http://localhost:8000/api/search
```

## Privacy Considerations

<Callout type="warning">
**Privacy by Design**

The sort by script option was designed to allow users to sort their results according to their preferences. In the context of Open Food Facts, those preferences can reveal data which should remain private.
</Callout>

### Privacy Measures

<Cards>
<Card title="POST Requests Only" description="We enforce using a POST request in the API to avoid accidental logging" />
<Card title="No Data Logging" description="We try hard not to log this data inside search-a-licious" />
</Cards>

## Performance Considerations

<Callout type="warning">
**Performance Impact**

When you use scripts for sorting, bear in mind that they need to be executed on each document.
</Callout>

<Steps>
<Step title="Test Performance">

Test your results on your full dataset to make sure performances are not an issue

</Step>
<Step title="Monitor System Load">

A heavy load on scripts sorting might affect other requests as well under heavy load
